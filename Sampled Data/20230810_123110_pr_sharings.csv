This is true for your album_ids_to_names associative array as well. After you source your script, you can access album_ids_to_names in the shell or script that sourced it.However, there are a couple of things to note:Associative arrays are a feature of Bash version 4 and later. If you're using an older version of Bash, or a different shell that doesn't support associative arrays, this might not work.In your script, you have a call to get_album_names. This appears to be a function call, but the function is not defined in the script you've provided. If get_album_names is defined in the environment of the calling script or in one of the sourced files (.env or .config), that's fine. Otherwise, you'll get an error when you try to run your script.Make sure to source the script (. script.sh or source script.sh) rather than execute it (./script.sh). If you execute the script, it will run in a separate process and its variables won't affect the calling environment."
"Add code from ChatGPT | 03, 20",Does feh interpret symbolic links properly?,"Yes, feh can handle symbolic links correctly. When it encounters a symbolic link, it will follow the link and display the image file that the link points to.This makes symbolic links a good way to create a temporary ""playlist"" of images for feh to display, without needing to move or copy the actual image files. This is especially useful in your case, where you want to filter the images based on metadata tags.So, using symbolic links in the script as suggested in the previous message should work correctly with feh. If you encounter any issues, please let me know, and I'll be happy to help troubleshoot."

"feat: use adaptive icons for android app | 03, 29",What is the background layer?,"In the context of adaptive icons for Android, the background layer is one of two layers that make up an adaptive icon. It serves as a backdrop for the icon's foreground layer.The adaptive icon is composed of two layers:Foreground layer: This contains the main visual elements of your icon, which could be your logo or main symbol. This layer is often visually more complex.Background layer: This is the bottom layer, and it sits behind the foreground. It typically features a solid color, gradient, or simple design, providing a backdrop against which the foreground layer stands out.When creating adaptive icons in Android, you can specify separate images or designs for both the foreground and background layers. Android will then animate these two layers independently when the user interacts with the icon.For example, in Image Asset Studio in Android Studio, you can select an image or clip art for the foreground and pick a color for the background. Or, you can select separate images for both layers."

	}","The author's question about the conditional statement if (c >= 0 && c < 4 && r >= 0 && r < 7) being always true is valid. It's a condition to check if the calculated c and r values fall within an expected range. These values represent column and row in an inventory with maximum of 4 columns and 7 rows, respectively.The problem is the way these indices are calculated. They are computed from the loop index index and should map to a position in a 4 columns x 7 rows grid, which matches the inventory layout of many games. If leftToRight is true, it loops through the grid left to right, top to bottom (more natural way). If it is false, it loops through the grid top to bottom, left to right.However, these calculations are based on the size of inventory (28 slots in a 4x7 grid), which means c and r should always be within their respective bounds. That's why the condition if (c >= 0 && c < 4 && r >= 0 && r < 7) is always true.This condition seems redundant and can be removed. The adjusted part of the code could be as follows:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this code, the condition has been removed and now we directly get the id from the inventory and proceed with the logic to drop items not included in the exception list. The assumption is that inventory is correctly initialized and the indices c and r always fall within the bounds of the inventory array."

This code does not always end on the trangles. Why is that and can you fix it?","The getPointNearCenter method is trying to find a point near the center of a set of polygons. It does this by first finding the bounding rectangle of all the points of the polygons. Then it computes the center of that rectangle (which may not be on any of the polygons). Finally, it generates a point based on a gaussian distribution with the center as the mean and a third of the width and height as the standard deviation.However, the Gaussian (or normal) distribution is not restricted to a specific range - it can theoretically generate any number from negative infinity to positive infinity. While the numbers it generates are more likely to be close to the mean, there's still a chance they could be beyond the minimum and maximum coordinates of the polygons, which means the point it generates might not land on the polygons at all.To fix this, you might want to generate a point that is definitely within one of the polygons. You could do this by picking a random polygon and then a random point within that polygon. For simplicity, let's assume that these polygons are triangles. Then you can generate a random point within a triangle using barycentric coordinates:[CODE_BLOCK_0]This function first chooses a random triangle from the set of triangles. Then it generates two random numbers between 0 and 1. These numbers are used as barycentric coordinates to generate a point that is guaranteed to be within the chosen triangle."

"Add code from ChatGPT | 02, 20",Can I get a performance improvement by linking instead of copying the images?,"Yes, creating symbolic links (also known as ""symlinks"") instead of copying files can improve performance and save disk space. Copying files is a relatively slow operation that involves reading the entire contents of the original file and writing it to a new location. By contrast, creating a symbolic link is a quick operation that simply creates a new directory entry pointing to the existing file. This operation is nearly instantaneous, regardless of the size of the original file.In the context of your script, using symbolic links means that the slideshow will display faster when it's initially started, especially if there are many large images to display.Here's how you can modify the script to use symbolic links:[CODE_BLOCK_0]This script works the same as the previous one, but it creates symbolic links in the temporary directory instead of copying the images. The ln -s command is used to create the symbolic links.Remember to replace /path/to/your/directory with the path to your images and replace tag1, tag2, tag3 with the tags you want to allow."
"git und github tutorial  | 01, 21",use the words he used to describe things,"Title: A Simple Guide to Git and GitHub, Explained Like You're a Five-Year-OldIntroductionHey kiddos! Today, we're going to learn about two cool things: Git and GitHub. They're like special tools for coding that help you save your progress and share your work with others. Let's break it down nice and easy!What is Git?Alright, so Git is like a magical memory card for your code. Imagine you're playing a video game, and you want to save your progress so that if something bad happens, you can go back to that point. Well, Git does the same thing for your code! It helps you save your changes, like when you add new files or make updates to your code.Here are the basic Git commands you need to know:Initializing a Git repository: When you want to use Git in your project folder, you need to say ""Hey Git, I want you here!"" And you do that by typing git init.Saving your changes: Just like taking a picture of your cool Lego creation, you tell Git, ""Hey, I want to save this!"" You can do that with the command git add . or git add filename if you want to save specific files.Committing changes: Now, it's like giving your saved picture a name. When you save, you have to say what you did, so you use git commit -m ""your message"" to tell Git what changes you made.Viewing commit history: Git keeps track of all your saved pictures, and you can look at them later. You use git log to see a list of all your saved changes.What is GitHub?Now, let's talk about GitHub. It's like a special website where you can show off your cool Lego creations to everyone! You can share your code, work with others, and see what they're building too.Here's how you use GitHub:Create a GitHub profile: First, you need to make a special profile on GitHub, just like signing up for a new game.Create a new repository: It's like making a new folder for your Lego creations. You follow the instructions on the website to do that.Connect your local project to GitHub: Now, you need to link your cool Lego folder on your computer to GitHub. You do that by typing git remote add origin <repository_url>.Share your code: Once you've made some cool changes and saved them with Git, you can push your code to GitHub using git push origin master.Collaborating on GitHub:Branches: Think of branches as making your own special copies of your Lego creations. You can work on new stuff without messing up the original. To create a branch, say ""I want a new copy!"" with git checkout -b branch_name.Merging: When you're done working on your new stuff, you might want to combine it with the original Lego creation. That's called merging, and you can do it with a pull request.Pulling changes: If someone else made cool changes to the original Lego creation on GitHub, you can pull those changes to your own project using git pull origin master.ConclusionSo, there you have it, little buddies! Git is like a memory card that saves your code changes, and GitHub is like a special website where you can show off your coding creations and work with others. Remember, just like with Lego, practice makes perfect, so keep coding and exploring the world of Git and GitHub! Happy coding, little champs!"
"Chatgpt | 03, 37","In your first bullet point, how would I update my CSS to add appropriate spacing between list items?","To add appropriate spacing between list items, you can use CSS margin properties. Here's an example of how you can update your CSS code:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In the above code, margin-top: 10px; and margin-bottom: 10px; are added to the ul selector to provide spacing above and below the entire unordered list. margin-bottom: 10px; is added to the li selector to create spacing between each list item.Feel free to adjust the values (e.g., 10px) as per your desired spacing preferences."

Correct any errors in this script which prevent it from doing that and then add echo statements documenting every part of the script.,"This script appears to download images from SmugMug based on an album ID, store them in a directory named after the album, remove old images not present in the album, and then create symbolic links to the images that match at least one keyword in a different directory. Here's a version of the script with added echo statements for documentation:[CODE_BLOCK_0]The script begins by sourcing the get-album-names.sh script to get the album id. Then, it loads the environment variables from the .env and .config files. These environment variables include the SmugMug API key and secret, the name of the album, and the allowed keywords.The script constructs a URL to request images from the album and makes the request to the SmugMug API. It then parses the response to get the file names and URIs of the images.For each image, the script checks if the image is already present in the album directory. If not, it downloads the image. It also updates the modification time of the image file to match the capture time.After downloading the new images, the script loops through all the files in the album directory and deletes any that are not present in the album.Finally, the script creates symbolic links to the images that match at least one of the allowed keywords. These symbolic links are stored in a different directory (images/feh). The script removes any old symbolic links in this directory before creating the new ones."
"Add code from ChatGPT | 00, 20","I need a bash script that executes `feh` pointing at a particular folder. It should display each of the images in the folder chronologically by capture date. The script should also repeat once it finishes all of the pictures. It needs to be able to acquire new pictures as they are added to the folder and to stop displaying images once they are removed. Ideally the script does a simple dissolve between images and a simple zoom on the image, but these are not necessary requirements.","Here's a basic bash script that uses feh to display images from a specific directory. In this script, I'm using the -r option to recursively look into the directory, -S option to sort the images by file modification time, and -D option to set the delay between slides. Please replace /path/to/your/directory with the actual path to your directory:[CODE_BLOCK_0]This script will run in an infinite loop, loading new images and removing old ones each time feh is called.Unfortunately, feh does not natively support transition effects such as dissolve or zoom between images. For that, you might need a more advanced slideshow software. There are other tools like imagemagick that can do these effects, but they cannot be incorporated into a real-time slideshow as easily.Please note that this script assumes that the images are being saved with their capture time as the file's modification time. If your camera is saving the capture time in the file's EXIF data, then you would need to use a tool like jhead to adjust the file's modification time to match the capture time before running the script."

This is another way to get the path of a command.If md5sum is still not found, type md5sum is executed. This command is used to describe how its argument would be interpreted if used as a command.This script effectively tries three different ways to find md5sum. If md5sum does not exist on the system, all three of these commands would fail, and MD5_PATH would be set to an empty string.Please note that the script is designed in such a way to suppress error outputs from individual commands in the chain, so you won't see any error messages if md5sum doesn't exist on your system.Also note, this script won't automatically handle the case where md5sum doesn't exist. If you use MD5_PATH later in your script, you should check that it's not empty before using it, and handle the error appropriately if it is.

"git und github tutorial  | 02, 21",übersetze das auf deutsch,"Titel: Ein einfacher Leitfaden zu Git und GitHub, erklärt wie für einen FünfjährigenEinleitungHallo, liebe Kinder! Heute werden wir über zwei coole Dinge sprechen: Git und GitHub. Das sind besondere Werkzeuge fürs Programmieren, die dir helfen, deinen Fortschritt zu speichern und deine Arbeit mit anderen zu teilen. Lasst uns das einfach und verständlich erklären!Was ist Git?Gut, also Git ist wie eine magische Speicherkarte für deinen Code. Stell dir vor, du spielst ein Videospiel und möchtest deinen Fortschritt speichern, damit du, wenn etwas schiefgeht, zu diesem Punkt zurückkehren kannst. Nun, Git macht dasselbe für deinen Code! Es hilft dir, deine Änderungen zu speichern, zum Beispiel wenn du neue Dateien hinzufügst oder Code aktualisierst.Hier sind die grundlegenden Git-Befehle, die du kennen musst:Initialisierung eines Git-Repositories: Wenn du Git in deinem Projektordner verwenden möchtest, sagst du ""Hey Git, ich möchte dich hier haben!"" und das machst du, indem du git init eingibst.Speichern deiner Änderungen: Genauso wie wenn du ein Bild von deinem coolen Lego-Gebilde machst, sagst du Git ""Hey, ich möchte das speichern!"" Das machst du mit dem Befehl git add . oder git add dateiname, wenn du bestimmte Dateien speichern möchtest.Bestätigen der Änderungen: Nun gibst du deinem gespeicherten Bild einen Namen. Wenn du speicherst, musst du sagen, was du gemacht hast, also benutzt du git commit -m ""deine Nachricht"", um Git zu sagen, welche Änderungen du vorgenommen hast.Anzeigen der Versionshistorie: Git behält eine Liste aller gespeicherten Bilder und du kannst sie dir später ansehen. Dazu benutzt du git log, um eine Liste all deiner gespeicherten Änderungen anzusehen.Was ist GitHub?Nun, lasst uns über GitHub sprechen. Das ist wie eine besondere Webseite, auf der du deine coolen Lego-Gebilde allen zeigen kannst! Du kannst deinen Code teilen, mit anderen zusammenarbeiten und sehen, was sie bauen.So benutzt du GitHub:Erstelle ein GitHub-Profil: Zuerst musst du ein spezielles Profil auf GitHub erstellen, genauso wie wenn du dich für ein neues Spiel anmeldest.Erstelle ein neues Repository: Das ist wie das Erstellen eines neuen Ordners für deine Lego-Gebilde. Folge den Anweisungen auf der Webseite, um das zu tun.Verbinde dein lokales Projekt mit GitHub: Jetzt musst du deinen coolen Lego-Ordner auf deinem Computer mit GitHub verknüpfen. Das machst du, indem du git remote add origin <repository_url> eingibst.Teile deinen Code: Sobald du einige coole Änderungen gemacht und sie mit Git gespeichert hast, kannst du deinen Code mit GitHub teilen, indem du git push origin master verwendest.Zusammenarbeit auf GitHub:Branches: Stell dir Branches vor wie eigene spezielle Kopien deiner Lego-Gebilde. Du kannst an neuen Sachen arbeiten, ohne das Original durcheinander zu bringen. Um einen Branch zu erstellen, sagst du ""Ich möchte eine neue Kopie!"" mit git checkout -b branch_name.Zusammenführen (Merging): Wenn du mit deinen neuen Sachen fertig bist, möchtest du sie vielleicht mit dem Original-Lego-Gebilde kombinieren. Das nennt man Zusammenführen und du kannst es mit einem Pull Request machen.Änderungen holen (Pulling changes): Wenn jemand anderes coole Änderungen am Original-Lego-Gebilde auf GitHub vorgenommen hat, kannst du diese Änderungen in dein eigenes Projekt holen, indem du git pull origin master verwendest.FazitSo, da habt ihr es, liebe Freunde! Git ist wie eine Speicherkarte, die deine Code-Änderungen speichert, und GitHub ist wie eine besondere Webseite, auf der du deine Programmierkreationen zeigen und mit anderen zusammenarbeiten kannst. Denkt daran, genau wie mit Lego, Übung macht den Meister, also bleibt am Ball und erkundet die Welt von Git und GitHub! Viel Spaß beim Programmieren, ihr kleinen Champions!"

"Changed: Paragraph and Sentence Tokenizer Documentation | 01, 41",what can be improved further?,"Overall, the revised documentation is quite clear and well-structured. However, there are a few areas where it could be further enhanced to provide additional clarity or context to users.Specify Required and Optional Parameters Clearly: The function, build_categorization_ai_pipeline, should clearly describe what each parameter represents, its datatype, and whether it's required or optional. This could be presented in a tabular format for better readability.Example Usage: Provide a simple code example demonstrating how to use build_categorization_ai_pipeline with different parameters.Explain Enum Use: While you mention that the list of models is implemented as an Enum, it might be helpful to briefly describe what an Enum is and why it is used in this context, especially for less experienced programmers.Provide More Details on Models: You might want to give more context about the Image Model and Text Model. For instance, explain when one might prefer to use one over the other, or both together. What are the advantages or limitations of each? This would provide the user with a better understanding of how to effectively use these models.Better Code Display: Use a better method to display the actual code snippet from the Python file. The ... placeholder doesn't give a clear idea of what the code looks like. If it's not feasible to include the whole code snippet in the documentation, consider providing a link to the source code file on your repository.Here's an improved version of the documentation, keeping the above points in mind:Available Categorization AI ModelsThe build_categorization_ai_pipeline function allows you to select which classification model to use. This could be an Image Module, a Text Module, or both.Parameters:Image Module (optional): This parameter allows you to use an image-based classification model. The available models are listed in the Image Models Enum.Text Module (optional): This parameter allows you to use a text-based classification model. The available models are listed in the Text Models Enum.Note: At least one of the Image or Text Model parameters must be specified.Example usage:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this code snippet, 'ModelA' and 'ModelB' are enum values representing the specific Image and Text models, respectively.The list of available Categorization Models can be found in an Enum in the /sdk/boilerplates/test_document_categorization.py file. An Enum, or enumerated type, is a data type that consists of a set of named values. We've used it here for easy reference to different categorization models.[CODE_BLOCK_1]Please replace ... with the actual code snippet, and remember to adjust the indentation by four spaces (dedent by 4) to align it properly with your code structure.The Image Module is best used when the data to be categorized includes images, while the Text Module is suited for text-based data. If your data contains both text and images, it could be beneficial to use both modules for a more comprehensive categorization.You can review the source code file in our repository here.

"Add code from ChatGPT | 10, 20","If I want to not automatically exit, can I use the `|| true` pattern?","Yes, you can use the || true pattern to prevent your script from exiting if a particular command fails. When used in a command pipeline, the || operator will only execute the command to its right if the command to its left exits with a non-zero status (indicating failure).So if you write source /path/to/nonexistent/file || true, the source command will fail, but then the true command will run and exit with a zero status, effectively ""ignoring"" the failure of the source command.Here's how you can use it:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Even if the file doesn't exist and the source command fails, the script won't exit and will continue to run the remaining commands.This is a common pattern used in shell scripts when you want to try running a command that might fail, and you want the script to continue running regardless.

Hi there,

this is to invite you to participate in Banzuke Surfing in the upcoming basho.
The rules are very simple.

Banzuke Surfing is run in several waves, with a new wave starting every year.

The goal is to move up the banzuke as far and fast as possible. You do so by temporarily ""adopting"" one or more rikishi at a given banzuke position. If your rikishi moves up the banzuke, so will you, if the rikishi moves down by getting MK, so will you (at least, if all your picked rikishi move down). If your rikishi goes intai, you will get his last position next time. In the basho after the current one you will be taking the banzuke position of the best-placed rikishi you've picked this time.

If your name appears on the list below, you have already participated. The column ""Allowed Picks"" shows you which rikishi of the banzuke you are allowed to pick next basho. If you are participating for the first time, you are allowed to pick any of the rikishi in the bottom 32 of the banzuke (as indicated below).
The rikishi that you are allowed to pick are all rikishi below your last (or most successful) pick. So generally, you cannot pick the same rikishi twice. An exception is if your rikishi drops into the last 32 of the banzuke or goes banzuke-gai. In this case, of course, you can pick any of the bottom 32 rikishi (just like a new player).

During your entire career of a given wave you can use up to three so-called jokers (indicated by the number of asterisks behind your name). In addition to the regular rikishi you pick for a basho, you can use one joker if still available. The more successful one of these two will determine your new banzuke position.

Deadline is shonichi 8 AM JST.

All new players are allowed to pick Jk6w Sawaisamu and below.

The player selects their preferred rikishi and clicks on the ""Start Playing"" button to confirm their choice. They also have the option to use up to three jokers during their gameplay.Continue Playing PageReturning players are directed to the ""Continue Playing"" page. This page displays a table similar to the one provided in your text. It shows each player's name, their last picked surfer, their position, and their allowed picks for the next round. The player can make their pick for the next round from a dropdown list. They also have the option to use a joker, if any are left.The ""Continue Playing"" page also has a button for the player to confirm their pick and submit their choices. Once the player makes a pick, their position and allowed picks are updated accordingly.Leaderboard PageA leaderboard is available that shows the rank, player name, last surfer picked, and their current position. This page is updated after each round.Rules and Help PageThis page contains detailed rules of the game. It explains the terms used in the game, such as rikishi, banzuke, basho, jokers, and more. It also provides tips and strategies to help players move up in the rankings.Account ManagementEach player should be able to create an account to participate in the game. This account would keep track of their history, including past picks and their progression over time. It would also manage their jokers usage.I hope this gives you a good starting point to create an engaging web interface for the Banzuke Surfing game. If you have specific features in mind, please let me know, and I can incorporate them into the design."
"Add code from ChatGPT | 17, 20",display-images.shDocument this script with echo statements to describe what it's doing and explain the script,"Here's your script with added echo statements to describe what it's doing:[CODE_BLOCK_0]This script is a bash shell script that runs an image slideshow using the feh image viewer.Here's a step-by-step explanation of what the script does:It gets the directory from which the script is being run (SCRIPT_DIR). This is done using a combination of dirname, cd, and pwd commands.It changes the current working directory to the script directory (pushd ""${SCRIPT_DIR}"").It loads environment variables from two files: .env and .config. If .env does not exist, it will not throw an error due to the || true part. The set -o allexport and set +o allexport commands are used to export all variables defined in these files to the environment of the script.It sets IMAGES_DIR to a directory named images/feh inside the script directory and creates this directory if it does not exist (mkdir -p ""${IMAGES_DIR}"").It changes the current working directory to the images directory (pushd ""${IMAGES_DIR}"").It enters an infinite loop, where it runs feh to display the images in IMAGES_DIR. The -r option is used for recursive image loading, -S mtime for sorting the images by modification time, and -D $SLIDE_DELAY for setting the slide delay to the value of the SLIDE_DELAY environment variable.After running feh, the script waits for one second (sleep 1), and then the loop repeats.The popd commands at the end are used to return to the previous working directories, but these commands are actually never reached due to the infinite loop."

When using `build_categorization_ai_pipeline`, you can select which Image Module and/or Text Module to use for 
classification. At least one between the Image Model or the Text Model must be specified. Both can also be used 
at the same time.
The list of available Categorization Models is implemented as an Enum containing the following elements:

 ","Both of these functions perform the same operation, which is to calculate the Intersection over Union (IoU) for two sets of bounding boxes. IoU is a measure of the overlap between two bounding boxes. It is used in object detection to measure the accuracy of the model.Here are the main differences:Language and Library: The first function box_iou is written using PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework that utilizes GPUs. The second function box_iou_batch is written using NumPy, a popular library for numerical computations in Python.Box Dimensions: Both functions expect the bounding boxes to be represented in the format (x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max). However, the first function expects the boxes to be tensors and the second function expects the boxes to be numpy arrays.Array Broadcasting: In the first function, unsqueeze is used to add an extra dimension to the box tensors to make them broadcastable for the operations that follow. In the second function, the None index is used to add an extra dimension to the box arrays for the same purpose.Clamping vs Clipping: Both functions calculate the intersection area of the boxes by first finding the dimensions of the intersecting rectangle and then taking the product of these dimensions. The first function uses clamp_ to ensure that the dimensions are at least 0 (since negative dimensions would not make sense), while the second function uses clip for the same purpose.Division by Zero: In the calculation of the IoU, the intersection area is divided by the union area. If the union area is zero, this would result in a division by zero. The first function adds a small constant (eps) to the denominator to prevent this, while the second function relies on the fact that the numerator would also be zero in this case, resulting in a NaN value which is acceptable in this context.In-place Operations: The first function uses in-place operations (clamp_ and prod) on tensors to save memory, while the second function does not use in-place operations.In conclusion, while both functions perform the same operation, they do so using different languages and libraries, and with slightly different methods and considerations. The choice between them would depend on the specific requirements of your project, such as whether you are using PyTorch or NumPy, whether you are working with tensors or arrays, and how you want to handle edge cases like zero union area."

"feat: use adaptive icons for android app | 00, 29","On android, the app icon I have is appearing edge to edge in some devices and in some devices it has a white border","This difference can occur due to the way different Android devices, or versions of Android, handle app icons. Android 8.0 (API level 26) introduced adaptive icons, which can display a variety of shapes across different device models. However, if an app doesn't provide an adaptive icon, or if the device is running an Android version that doesn't support them, it might add a white background to make the icon match other icons.To make sure your icon appears consistently across all devices, you can use Android Studio's Image Asset Studio to create adaptive icons. It allows you to create different foreground and background layers for your icon, which the system then uses to create an adaptive icon.Here's a brief guide:Right-click the res folder and select New > Image Asset.On the ""Asset Type"" dropdown, select Adaptive and Legacy.Click on the Foreground Layer or Background Layer tabs to upload or design your icon.Preview how your icon looks with different shapes and in different sizes, and adjust your design if necessary.Click Next > Finish.Remember, the key to a good adaptive icon is simplicity. Complex designs may not look good in small sizes or with certain shapes. The Android documentation offers more guidance on designing adaptive icons."
"tsh: Implement puttyconfig command to add saved PuTTY sessions to Windows registry | 01, 154",Is this the correct way to validate a hostname?,"The regex pattern you provided is a decent way to validate a large subset of hostnames, but it's not perfect. There are edge cases and specifics that it does not cover. Here are a couple of them:Length: The total length of a full domain name (including dots) is limited to 253 characters, and individual labels (each part between the dots) are limited to 63 characters. The provided regex does not account for these restrictions.International Domain Names (IDNs): These domain names can include characters outside the traditional a-z, 0-9, and hyphen. Your regex does not account for these characters. IDNs are converted to Punycode for DNS lookups, so you could argue that you should only need to validate the Punycode version, but that depends on your specific application.Underscores: While underscores (_) are not permitted in hostnames according to the specification, some systems do use them and they are often permitted in practice. If you need to allow for these, your regex would need to change.So, to fully validate a hostname, you'd need to take these things into account, and possibly others depending on your exact use case. However, if you're sure that your hostnames will always be fairly ""normal"", this regex could be fine for you.In any case, it's important to remember that validation by regex only provides a preliminary check. If you're doing something like resolving the hostname to an IP address, the lookup itself will be the ultimate test of whether the hostname is valid or not."

"git und github tutorial  | 00, 21","every resource about git or github
if you look up a git tutorial they over
complicate it
and i've always said this you might not
like this if you're super analytical and
you want me to talk
like a scientist but the best way for
you to understand me
is if i talk to you like you're an idiot
and when i was in college that's exactly
what i wanted for my professors
teach me like i'm a five-year-old
because that's how i think
so i'm gonna break down get instead of
you going and watching the
six part tutorial or paying or whatever
it's really very simple if i teach you
it
in hey i'm gonna teach you like
you are a child and you are my children
and if you're my new child meaning
you're just born
then hit subscribe and like the video
alright so this is unscripted but first
thing i'm going to say
get this out there git and github
are two different things i'm going to
talk about both of them in this video
but i'm going to start with git so let's
begin
what is git well
git is a software that comes with your
computer
and installed on your computer if you
have mac or linux
so if you have a macbook or an apple
computer you have git already
or linux computer you have you already
have git if you have windows
you have to download it so you're gonna
have to download something called git
bash you go to the website you download
it and then it's like a little terminal
window use that is git something you
need
to know yes git is something you need to
know you are not going to be
successful at programming without
knowing git everyone needs to know it
it's like one of the most basic things
it's like terminal you need to know term
you need to know a command line
you need to know git and then you need
to know how to code okay
so what is git do why do i need to know
it here we go
this is as simple as it gets simple as
it gets get
is a memory card for code

if you have a project with a bunch of
files
html css javascript
whatever programming language you want
you want just like how you have a video
game
you want to save your progress as you go
that way if you die you don't lose
all of your progress so with git
every so often you're going to enter a
command
to save your progress now this is
locally on your computer
nobody else can access this you have
this on your computer
so i'm going to go through an example
now i'm going to create a folder
get video i'm going to go into my git
video and then i'm going to make an
index.html file and an app.css file
so i made a folder and i made an html
file
and a css file now if one of these files
gets deleted
i didn't save my progress it's gone
forever
i don't know what was in the file if i
wrote a bunch of html or css
one of the files gets deleted poof oh
well
i can't do anything about that it's gone
forever but if i use
get and i save that i made these files
i could save them with the contents of
the files
and when one gets deleted i can go back
to my saved progress now to use git
you have to know a few commands there's
only a few
and it's not that hard to understand the
first one
is initializing your
folder or project with git
to do that you have to have get
downloaded and then you type
get init initialized empty git
repository
great so that's the same thing as you're
putting a memory card
into your game system because you
obviously can't save the game without
memory
so here we go now we can use git we want
to
save our progress how do we do that well
git add is what you want to save
we can save all of our progress
meaning all of our changes since the
last time we saved
or we could just save a very specific
thing
so after git add you want to put
either maybe a file that you want to
save
so i could just save index.html
but if app.css gets deleted it's gone
forever but i could just save
any changes i've made to index.html
or i can save everything so
git add space period would save
everything
that i've done since the last time i
saved i almost
never commit a specific file i
usually push changes on everything
so in 95 cases
you are going to use git add period and
commit
all of the changes that you've made okay
so now i've said what changes i'm saving
which i chose to save everything now if
we were to get technical
i have added all files to the staging
area
but that might just confuse you so don't
even think about that i've added the
files i want to commit i've added
everything
i am going to save everything now git
commit
actually commits those changes to memory
so you type git commit and then you need
to do
dash m for a message
dash m and describe the changes
describe the save this way when we look
back if we want to go back to this save
progress we know what we're going back
to so you make the message
about what you're saving makes sense so
i'm going to say add
html and css file

two files changed you see that i created
two files
it got saved that progress got saved
now if i delete my html file

and i add a
javascript file well now i've made some
more changes
and i could save my game again so now we
only have
app.js and app.css so let's do it again
save all my changes git commit dash m
delete html and add js

so i've saved my progress twice now
what we've gone over so far is how to
add the files you want to save
and then commit with the message to
you know save the progress of the
message
and get in it to you know start it up
now
if we type git log we can look
at our saved the times we saved
look at this so this is the first time
we saved
it it's a log get log it's a log of all
of your
saved changes add html and css

just gives you the time gives you the
date fantastic and then it gives you
this little hash code used to go back to
it
and then look at this there's our second
one time and date
with the hash code now if i want to go
back
to my previous progress with the html
and the css
where we saved i can copy this
like hash code thingy majig
and then look at this get checkout to
check out that commit
let's see where we're at
oh we're back to our
first saved progress
now here's the tricky part is that when
we go back in time
we're in a different branch
so so now timelines
are getting messed up and we're in a
time machine oh god dude maybe
maybe i shouldn't go with the time
machine analogy
i want to keep this i want to keep this
organized and i don't want to
give too much to you to confuse you now
what is github
now what is git hub well github
is a website
and it's the same thing as bitbucket and
it's the same thing as git lab
they are websites where i just
put the stuff that's on my computer all
my saved progress is on my computer
and i put it all on the internet
so that other people can download my
code
and then go through all my saved
progress they could go back and forth
they could jump through time loops and
go back to my save progress and look
through all my code
and do whatever the hell they want to do
so how do you get your code onto github
well you make a github
profile and then you make a repository
repository means folder
folder means repository same thing so
you're on your thing you go to
repositories on your profile
you hit new you hit new repository you
type the name of it
mine was get video description you could
have a public or private whatever
so now once you do that it gives you
instructions
to hook this up to your folder on your
computer
my folder is on my computer i want it on
the website
it tells me how to do that it gives you
specific instructions
it says get remote add origin
this is a command to just hook it up to
the website
so let's just do that alright ready boom
okay i added the origin
and now this is called a push so you
have your saved
commits you save progress and then you
push it you push to the website

okay and now we go to the website
and there is our code people ladies and
gentlemen
there is our code the css the js
and then the two commits that we can
look through
here's the first one with the html css
here's the second one now someone else
can go to my profile and see this and
they can download it onto theirs
and that's why github is something you
have to know
so you can work with others on projects
from different areas in the world
because whenever i save my progress i
push it up to github
and whenever they want to see what i'm
doing they go to my github
and they can just pull my code down or
they can just look at it on my profile
now do i want to go into branches right
now no
i don't this video's already been long
enough but i will
now there's these things called branches
so the by default all the code is on
a master branch don't overthink this
i know you're overthinking that that
just means that's regular
that's just regular that's just you
coding you're saving your changes they
get saved to the master memory
but someone can go off like in a video
game they
could trail off your game and then
you know when you play a video game and
then you do something and it's on your
friend's account
but you don't want to save onto their
account because they still might want to
play what you just did
so you save it into a new file so that's
a different branch
someone could download my code make
changes
and they do it on a different branch so
if we go back to our folder
and i type git checkout dash b that's
going to make a new
branch and i'm going to call it new
branch you put the name of the branch
you want to make
so now i have a new branch open and
there's a master one still but now i
have new branch and i can
make changes and it won't affect
the main game saving the main code
getting saved
it will just be my own branch trailing
off of that code
so i'm going to add a python file
app.pi and i'm going to
commit i'm going to do git add
everything add all my changes
git commit add python file
and now if i do a git log you can see i
got my three commits
and this but this is for my new branch
i'm on new branch here but this stuff is
from
master now the cool part about branches

is that i can merge my
changes on new branch into master if i
want to
or i cannot do that if i don't want to
so if i want to merge all of if i change
like 50 things on my new branch
i can push them all into the main one if
i feel like it
and if i don't want to then fine i don't
i could delete the branch i could do
whatever i want it's
irrelevant until it goes into master so
the point of branches
is so that other people can download
your project
they can go and make changes on a
separate branch
and then they could come to you and be
like dude i made all these changes i
didn't want to mess up what you were
doing
but hey look at these if you like them
merge them into what you are doing
and then i can so what they would do on
github
is they would say hey let's push origin
new branch you could push the new branch
up to github
oh look at that there's two branches on
github now one of them is new branch
one of them is master so if someone
wanted to say hey dude check out my
progress
they could do what's called a poll
request
and whoever owns the repository is gonna
get that and look it over and say hey
these are good or not
so you could say hey dude i changed
some stuff check it out and then you
create it
and then whoever owns the project might
be like oh this guy wanted to change
some stuff
let's see what he changed oh they looked
he added a python file maybe i want that
so that looks pretty good good job dude
you made some good changes
and then you merge it into the master
and then you confirm the merge
and look at that dude now it's merged
into the master
and you know dude it's got the the
commits
from the new branch they got pulled into
the freaking
master branch so now everything is in
the main area
because the guy liked the new branch now
one thing that's important is you always
want your local computer
synced up to github you want these
connected
because it could get out of whack you
need these to be at the same spot
so when there's changes on github that
you don't have on your computer
you want to pull those changes down
to your computer you push when you have
changes that github doesn't have
you push them up to github when github
has changes that you don't have
you pull them down from github
so i will do git pull origin master
and now i pulled down those changes that
python
merging that went on up there i got them
now on my computer
and we could check that out we got the
merge we got the python file
and everything is now on our local
computer now for rebasing
i do need to get a little more technical
with this
and i think i might make a future video
specifically about get rebase
but these are the basics and you can
probably get by
on just these and maybe pick up rebasing
on your own
i don't want to over complicate or make
you overthink
these are the basics this is all you
need to get started using git
and github you don't even need to get
into branches really because you might
not even be working with those right now
just pushing your code up pulling your
code down
making the changes the save changes
when there's stuff on the github that
you don't have
pull it when there's stuff on your
computer github doesn't have
push it you do not need github to use
git
and you you probably do need to get to
use github but
you don't need a github if you just want
to save your changes
but you need a github probably when you
want to collaborate with other people
in different places and you'll probably
need it for like every project
ever now some parting words about github
that you might be interested in
people will judge me because i don't
have all these green squares
so if you want to set up some kind of
auto commit
thing you get a green square if you push
code to github every day
so people like to code every day and
have all these squares look green
and sometimes they don't push anything
useful
they might specifically change or add a
comment
just so that they have a green square on
github
these are people called clout chasers
specifically github clout chasers and uh
they don't
make impactful contributions to projects
and they specifically want green squares
to flex on other developers
you can be one of them or you can let it
go
and just move through and
actually you know do real things with
your life
so that is it for this video i hope i
made this very easy for you to
understand
and i'm going to put a black screen at
the end
with all the commands we went over and
there's only a few
and it's pretty straightforward so that

turn this into an informative blog article by only using the information provided","Title: A Simple Guide to Git and GitHub for BeginnersIntroductionGit and GitHub are essential tools for developers to manage code and collaborate with others. This guide aims to break down the concepts of Git and GitHub in simple terms, avoiding unnecessary complexities, and focusing on the basics. Let's get started with an easy-to-understand explanation.What is Git?Git is a software installed on your computer that acts like a memory card for code. When working on a project with various files (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript), Git allows you to save your progress periodically. This way, if something gets deleted or goes wrong, you can easily revert to a previous version.The basic Git commands you need to know:Initializing a Git repository:
To start using Git in your project folder, run the command git init.Saving your changes:
Use git add . to add all changes or git add filename to add specific files you want to save.Committing changes:
After adding changes, commit them using git commit -m ""your message"". This message helps you identify the changes later.Viewing commit history:
Use git log to see a log of your saved changes along with their timestamps.What is GitHub?GitHub is a website where you can store your Git repositories online. It allows you to share your code with others, collaborate on projects, and track changes easily.To use GitHub:Create a GitHub profile.Create a new repository by following the instructions on the website.Connect your local project folder to GitHub using the command git remote add origin <repository_url>.Push your local commits to GitHub using git push origin master.Collaborating on GitHub:Branches:
Branches allow you to work on separate versions of your code without affecting the main project. Use git checkout -b branch_name to create a new branch.Merging:
Once you have made changes on a branch and want to incorporate them into the main project, you can merge the branch using a pull request.Pulling changes:
If someone else made changes on GitHub, use git pull origin master to get the latest updates to your local repository.ConclusionUnderstanding Git and GitHub is crucial for developers, as it helps with version control and collaboration. Git serves as a local memory card for your code, while GitHub allows you to share your work with others and contribute to open-source projects. By following these simple commands and principles, you'll be well-equipped to manage your code effectively. Remember, practice is key to mastering these tools, so don't hesitate to start using Git and GitHub for your projects. Happy coding!"

This is why the SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'export' error is occurring.There are several ways to resolve this issue:Browsers that support ES6 modules: If you're running your script in a browser that supports ES6 modules (most modern browsers do), you should include your script with type ""module"" in your HTML file like this:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Then, in your other scripts or HTML files where you want to use the Game class, import it as follows:[CODE_BLOCK_1]Babel: If you're targeting browsers that don't support ES6 modules, you'll need to transpile your ES6 code to ES5 using a tool like Babel.Bundler Tools: If you're using a bundler like Webpack or Rollup, you can configure them to resolve these modules and package them in a format that can be consumed by the browser.If you choose to use Babel or a bundler, you will typically set up a build process that transpiles your code whenever you make changes, so you always have an up-to-date version of your script that's compatible with your target environments."
"Add code from ChatGPT | 12, 20",Should I ever source a script to execute it from within another script as opposed to just using ./script.sh?,"Whether you should source a script (source script.sh or . script.sh) or execute it (./script.sh) depends on what you want to achieve.Sourcing a script (source script.sh or . script.sh): This reads and executes commands from the filename argument in the current shell context. If the script sets environmental variables or changes the current directory, these changes will be reflected in the shell that sourced the script. This is often used for loading environment variables or shell configuration from a script.Executing a script (./script.sh): This runs the script in a new shell process. Any environmental variables set or directory changes made in the script will not affect the calling shell. This is the usual way to run scripts that perform a series of commands and don't need to modify the environment of the calling shell.So, if you want the script to modify the environment of the calling script (for example, setting environment variables), use source. If you want the script to perform actions (like processing data) and its environment changes shouldn't affect the calling script, use ./.Remember that scripts need to have execute permissions (chmod +x script.sh) to be run with ./. Sourcing a script with source or . doesn't require execute permissions, as it's read and executed by the current shell."
"feature: add script to set up new posts | 01, 13",Can we do this as a pure bash script?,"Yes, we can create a pure Bash script to achieve the same functionality. Below is the Bash script that takes a string as an argument and creates a new folder with the provided template in it. Save the following code in a file named create_markdown.sh:[CODE_BLOCK_0]To use this Bash script, open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved create_markdown.sh, and make the script executable using the following command:[CODE_BLOCK_1]Then, you can run the script with the desired title as an argument. For example:[CODE_BLOCK_2]The script will create a new folder with the title in lowercase and underscores as spaces and generate a markdown file inside the folder with the provided template."
"Add code from ChatGPT | 14, 20",What then is the purpose of the export keyword?,"The export keyword in a shell script or terminal session is used to make a variable available to subprocesses of the shell where the export command is run. This means that the exported variable can be accessed by any scripts or programs that are run from the same shell after the variable is exported.For example, if you run the following commands in a shell:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Then script.sh will be able to access the value of VAR:[CODE_BLOCK_1]This script would print ""Hello, world!"".However, export does not make the variable permanently available in different terminal sessions or in parent processes. It also does not make the variable available to scripts that are run in their own shell (i.e., scripts that are not sourced).In the context of your previous question, sourcing a script allows all variables (not just those marked with export) to be used in the calling script. But those variables will not be available to other scripts that the calling script runs, unless those scripts are also sourced. To make variables available to scripts that are run (not sourced) from the calling script, you would need to export those variables."

Here's a more detailed breakdown:The ^ character marks the start of the line.(([a-zA-Z0-9]|[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-]*[a-zA-Z0-9]).)* : This is the part of the regex that matches any subdomains. It's made up of a couple of parts:[a-zA-Z0-9] matches any single alphanumeric character.[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-]*[a-zA-Z0-9] matches an alphanumeric character, followed by any number of alphanumeric characters or dashes, and ends with an alphanumeric character. This pattern ensures that if a dash is used, it must be surrounded by alphanumeric characters (which is a requirement in domain names).The . at the end of this section is there to match the dot that separates subdomains.The outermost () encloses this whole pattern, and the * at the end allows for zero or more of this pattern.([A-Za-z0-9]|[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9-]*[A-Za-z0-9]) : This part matches the actual domain name (which follows the same pattern as the subdomains).The $ character marks the end of the line.So, this regular expression is matching DNS hostnames like ""example.com"", ""sub.example.com"", or even ""a.b.c.example.com"". It doesn't allow for trailing dots, leading or trailing dashes, or multiple consecutive dots."
"Github Actions とpre-commitにpoetry exportを適用 | 03, 138",ユーザーに追加の手順を要求しない方法を教えてください。,ユーザーに追加の手順を要求せずに、異なる環境で動作するスクリプトを作成するための一つの方法は、プラットフォームに依存しないプログラミング言語を使用することです。しかし、それでもランタイムが必要な言語（Python、Node.jsなど）は問題となります。そのため、一つの解決策は、プラットフォームに依存しない、かつランタイムが不要な言語でスクリプトを書くことです。そのような言語の一つがGo言語です。Goはクロスコンパイルが可能で、一度コンパイルされたバイナリはランタイムなしで動作します。つまり、Goで書かれたプログラムは、それがコンパイルされたプラットフォーム（Windows、Linux、Macなど）で直接実行することができます。以下に、Goで書かれたpre-commitフックの例を示します：[CODE_BLOCK_0]このスクリプトはGoのテストを実行し、テストが失敗した場合はエラーメッセージを出力して終了コード1で終了します。このスクリプトはGoで書かれていますが、go buildを使ってバイナリにコンパイルすることができます。そして、そのバイナリはGoのランタイムなしで実行することができます。ただし、このアプローチにはいくつかの欠点があります。第一に、スクリプトをGoで書く必要があります。第二に、バイナリは各プラットフォームごとにコンパイルする必要があります。第三に、バイナリはソースコードと比べて大きなサイズになる可能性があります。

This means that any variables set or modified in the sourced file will affect the current shell environment.So in your script, ALBUM_NAME is first set to the value of $2, and then it's potentially overwritten when you source the .config file. If you want the value from $2 to take precedence, you could check if it's set and non-empty before sourcing .config:[CODE_BLOCK_0]This line will set ALBUM_NAME to its current value if it's set and non-empty, otherwise it will set ALBUM_NAME to $2.

"Github Actions とpre-commitにpoetry exportを適用 | 00, 138",pre-commitでbashスクリプトを実行するようにしたところ、windowsには環境がなくて実行できないことがわかりました。どの環境でもだいたい動くようにするにはどうすればよいでしょうか。,pre-commitフックでbashスクリプトを実行すると、そのスクリプトはGitがインストールされているすべての環境で動作する必要があります。Windowsでは、デフォルトではbashが利用できないため、問題が発生します。この問題を解決するための一般的なアプローチは以下の通りです：スクリプトをPythonやNode.jsなど、複数のプラットフォームでサポートされている言語に書き換える：これにより、スクリプトはWindows、Linux、Macなど、さまざまな環境で動作します。ただし、このアプローチを使用するには、その言語のランタイムがインストールされていることが必要です。Windowsでbashを利用可能にする：Windowsユーザーに対して、Git Bash、Cygwin、Windows Subsystem for Linux（WSL）などのツールをインストールするように指示することができます。これらのツールはWindowsでbashを利用可能にします。ただし、これはユーザーに追加の手順を要求することになります。プラットフォームに依存しないシェルスクリプトを使用する：シェルスクリプトはbashとは異なり、Windowsでもネイティブに動作します。ただし、bashと比較して機能が限定されているため、スクリプトの複雑さによってはこのアプローチが適用できない場合もあります。これらのアプローチのどれが最適かは、具体的な要件と制約によります。例えば、スクリプトが非常に複雑である場合、PythonやNode.jsに書き換えることが最善の選択となるかもしれません。一方、スクリプトが比較的単純である場合、プラットフォームに依存しないシェルスクリプトに書き換えることが適切かもしれません。

Is there anything I can do to make the script resilient so that it restarts automatically if the system restarts or if the script crashes?","The script provided above will not be able to run continuously while updating the images and tags. This is because of the sleep 86400 command which makes the script wait for 24 hours before it runs again.If you want to update the images and tags every 24 hours while keeping the slideshow running continuously, you can run the image updating part of the script as a separate cron job, and run the feh slideshow command in its own infinite loop.Here's how you can divide the tasks:1.

The never type is used to ensure that all cases are handled and that new cases aren't forgotten. The technique is called Exhaustiveness checking in TypeScript.However, instead of using an inline arrow function, you could use a helper function to assert exhaustiveness. This would improve readability and remove the necessity for eslint disabling:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In the assertNever function, we are throwing an error if an unexpected value is encountered. This could be useful during development because it would crash your application at the source of the problem if you forget to add a case when extending your provider. Of course, the thrown error would be a problem in a production application, so you need to make sure that your switch is exhaustive during testing and before deployment."
