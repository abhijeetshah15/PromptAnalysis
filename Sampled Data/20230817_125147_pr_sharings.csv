}","The error message you're encountering, 'dict' object has no attribute 'encode', still points to the fact that somewhere in your code, there's an attempt to encode a dictionary object. This typically happens when a function or method is trying to treat a dictionary as a string and calling .encode() on it.In the context of AWS Lambda and Mangum, it seems that the error is occurring within the Mangum adapter when processing the HTTP request. The maybe_encode_body function within mangum.handlers.utils is attempting to encode the request body, but the body should already be in a format that can be encoded. It's possible that there is some misconfiguration or error in the setup.Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot this issue:Review your app/main.py code, especially where the Mangum adapter is used to handle the incoming request. Make sure you're not accidentally using a dictionary where a string is expected.Ensure that your Lambda handler function is correctly structured to work with Mangum. Your handler function should look something like this:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Double-check the version compatibility between Mangum, FastAPI, and other dependencies. Sometimes, version mismatches can lead to unexpected errors.Verify that your FastAPI application (or whatever ASGI app you're using) is correctly handling the incoming request and returning a response in the expected format.If you're using any custom middleware or processing logic, review that code to ensure it's not causing the issue.If you're still encountering issues after these steps, it might be helpful to share relevant portions of your code (such as the Lambda handler function, the Mangum setup, and how you're handling the incoming request) so that I can provide more targeted assistance."
"Github Actions とpre-commitにpoetry exportを適用 | 02, 146",PythonやNode.jsもそのランタイムがインストールされていない環境だと問題になります。pythonはpython3がインストールされているときに問題になります。,その通りで、PythonやNode.jsのランタイムがインストールされていない環境では、それらの言語で書かれたスクリプトは動作しません。また、Python2とPython3の間には互換性の問題があり、Python2で書かれたスクリプトはPython3のランタイムでは必ずしも動作しない可能性があります。これらの問題を解決するための一つの方法は、Dockerを使用することです。Dockerを使用すると、スクリプトが実行される環境を完全に制御することができます。つまり、スクリプトが必要とするすべての依存関係（Python、Node.js、bashなど）を含むDockerイメージを作成し、そのイメージを使用してスクリプトを実行することができます。これにより、スクリプトはどの環境でも一貫して動作します。ただし、このアプローチにはいくつかの欠点があります。第一に、ユーザーはDockerをインストールして設定する必要があります。第二に、Dockerイメージの作成と管理は追加の作業を必要とします。別のアプローチとして、スクリプトを最小限の依存関係で書くことも考えられます。例えば、シェルスクリプトをPOSIX準拠のシェル（/bin/sh）で書くことで、多くのUNIX系システムで動作するスクリプトを作成することができます。Windowsユーザーには、Windows Subsystem for Linux（WSL）をインストールするか、Git Bashを使用するように指示することができます。ただし、これもユーザーに追加の手順を要求することになります。どのアプローチが最適かは、具体的な要件と制約によります。

"[PR fix] Caching updates | 00, 56",What's a magic number in programming?,"In programming, a ""magic number"" refers to a numeric literal that is used directly in the code without any explanation or clear context. These numbers are often arbitrary and lack proper documentation or meaningful variable names to indicate their purpose. Magic numbers can make the code harder to understand, maintain, and debug, as their purpose might not be immediately apparent to other developers (including your future self).Using magic numbers can lead to several issues:Readability and Maintenance: Code with magic numbers can be difficult to read and understand, especially for someone who didn't write the code. Without proper context, it's unclear why a specific number is used, what it represents, or what calculations are being performed.Error-Prone: If a magic number is used in multiple places within your code and you decide to change its value, you have to update it in all occurrences, which can lead to errors if you miss one or forget to update it consistently.Lack of Flexibility: Using magic numbers makes your code less flexible. If you need to adjust a value or parameter, you would have to find and change all occurrences of the magic number manually.Understanding and Debugging: When bugs or issues arise, it can be challenging to identify the source of the problem if you're dealing with magic numbers. Debugging becomes more complicated without clear variable names or comments explaining the purpose of the numbers.To mitigate the issues caused by magic numbers, it's a good practice to:Use Constants or Enumerations: Define constants or enumerations with meaningful names to represent these numbers. This improves code readability and allows you to change the value in a single place if needed.Add Comments: If using a magic number is unavoidable, add a comment explaining its significance and usage.Extract into Functions: If the number represents a specific calculation or operation, consider encapsulating that logic into a function with a descriptive name. This abstracts away the details and provides a clear interface for using that logic.By following these practices, you can make your code more readable, maintainable, and less error-prone, enhancing the overall quality of your software."

リソース管理にこれらの機能を使うことは、「広義のRAII」と言えるでしょうか?",「RAII」（Resource Acquisition Is Initialization）は、C++のプログラミングパラダイムの1つで、リソースの取得と初期化を同じ手続きで行い、オブジェクトのライフタイムがそのリソースのライフタイムと一致するように設計されています。これにより、リソースのリークや使用後の放棄といった問題を回避することができます。上記の言語機能は、RAIIのコンセプトを広義に取り入れていると言えるでしょう。それぞれの機能は、リソースの取得と放棄を自動的に管理することを目的としており、RAIIの基本的な考え方と合致しています。具体的には:GCCのcleanup: 特定の関数を変数のクリーンアップ時に自動的に呼び出す属性を提供します。Goのdefer: 関数の終了時に実行される関数をスケジュールする機能です。Pythonのwith: コンテキストマネージャとして知られるオブジェクトを使用して、リソースの取得と放棄を自動化します。Javaのtry-with-resource: AutoCloseableまたはCloseableインターフェースを実装したリソースを自動的に閉じる機能を提供します。C#'のusing: IDisposableインターフェースを実装したオブジェクトのDisposeメソッドを自動的に呼び出す機能を提供します。これらの機能は、異なる形や方法でRAIIの原則を実現しています。したがって、これらの機能を「広義のRAII」と呼ぶことは妥当であると考えられます。

The error is happening while trying to establish a connection to the OpenAI API, which is causing the Mangum application to fail.Here are a few things you can do to troubleshoot and fix this issue:Check OpenAI API Keys: Make sure you're using the correct API key to interact with the OpenAI API. Double-check if the API key is valid and properly set up.Check Internet Connectivity: Ensure that your Lambda function running locally has internet connectivity to communicate with the OpenAI API. Sometimes, network issues can cause such failures.Retry Logic: It seems that the HTTP request to the OpenAI API is encountering a retry mechanism, which is indicating potential connectivity issues. Check your retry logic or settings to see if they are causing unintended behavior.Update Dependencies: Update the dependencies you're using, including mangum, openai, and any other libraries. Sometimes, updates can address known issues or bugs.Review Request Format: Double-check the format of the request you're sending to the OpenAI API. Make sure it's correctly formatted according to the OpenAI API documentation.Error Handling: Implement proper error handling in your code to capture and log any errors that occur during the interaction with the OpenAI API. This will provide more specific information about the nature of the error.Debugging: If possible, add more detailed logging and debugging statements to your code to understand where exactly the error is occurring. This will help pinpoint the issue.Test API Call Separately: Test the API call to the OpenAI API separately from your Lambda function to confirm whether the issue is specific to your Lambda environment or if it's a broader issue.Consult Documentation: Check the documentation for both Mangum and OpenAI to ensure you're using the correct configuration and setup for both.If the issue persists after trying these steps, consider reaching out to the OpenAI support or community forums for further assistance, as they might have more specific guidance on handling API-related errors."

and one to destroy the infra","Organizing your GitHub Actions workflows for linting, formatting, testing, building and pushing Docker images, running Terraform scripts, and destroying infrastructure can greatly enhance the readability and maintainability of your repository. Here's an example structure you could use:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this structure, each workflow directory contains the workflow YAML files for a specific set of tasks. Here's a breakdown of each directory and its contents:lint-format: This directory contains workflows for linting and formatting tasks.frontend.yml: Lints and formats the frontend code.backend.yml: Lints and formats the backend code.You can add more YAML files for other parts of your project if needed.tests.yml: This workflow focuses on running tests for your project.docker-build-push.yml: This workflow handles building Docker images and pushing them to a container registry.terraform-deploy.yml: This workflow runs Terraform scripts to deploy infrastructure.terraform-destroy.yml: This workflow is responsible for destroying the deployed infrastructure using Terraform.You can adjust the names and structures of the workflows to fit your project's conventions and needs. The goal is to keep each set of related tasks organized in its own directory, making it easier to manage and understand the purpose of each workflow.Additionally, within each workflow YAML file, you can define the specific steps, conditions, and configurations needed for that workflow. By following this organization approach, you'll create a more maintainable and scalable set of GitHub Actions workflows that align with your project's requirements."

- name: Format with Prettier
        run: npm run format","The code snippet you provided is using npm run format, which typically triggers the execution of a tool like Prettier to format the code according to predefined style rules. However, the specific behavior of the npm run format command depends on how it is configured in your project's package.json file.Formatting tools like Prettier are designed to automatically format code to adhere to consistent coding style guidelines. So, when you run a command like npm run format, it will actually apply the formatting changes to the code.If you only want to check whether the code conforms to the formatting rules without applying any changes, you might want to use a different command provided by the formatting tool. For example, Prettier provides a --check flag that allows you to check the code's formatting without making any changes:[CODE_BLOCK_0]This command will check whether the code adheres to the specified formatting rules and will provide a report of any formatting issues. If there are issues, it won't modify the code.So, if you want to check the formatting without making changes, you should modify your workflow step like this:[CODE_BLOCK_1]Replace frontend with the actual directory where your frontend code is located. This will run the formatting check without modifying the code."

"Add code from ChatGPT | 14, 21",What then is the purpose of the export keyword?,"The export keyword in a shell script or terminal session is used to make a variable available to subprocesses of the shell where the export command is run. This means that the exported variable can be accessed by any scripts or programs that are run from the same shell after the variable is exported.For example, if you run the following commands in a shell:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Then script.sh will be able to access the value of VAR:[CODE_BLOCK_1]This script would print ""Hello, world!"".However, export does not make the variable permanently available in different terminal sessions or in parent processes. It also does not make the variable available to scripts that are run in their own shell (i.e., scripts that are not sourced).In the context of your previous question, sourcing a script allows all variables (not just those marked with export) to be used in the calling script. But those variables will not be available to other scripts that the calling script runs, unless those scripts are also sourced. To make variables available to scripts that are run (not sourced) from the calling script, you would need to export those variables."

	}","The author's question about the conditional statement if (c >= 0 && c < 4 && r >= 0 && r < 7) being always true is valid. It's a condition to check if the calculated c and r values fall within an expected range. These values represent column and row in an inventory with maximum of 4 columns and 7 rows, respectively.The problem is the way these indices are calculated. They are computed from the loop index index and should map to a position in a 4 columns x 7 rows grid, which matches the inventory layout of many games. If leftToRight is true, it loops through the grid left to right, top to bottom (more natural way). If it is false, it loops through the grid top to bottom, left to right.However, these calculations are based on the size of inventory (28 slots in a 4x7 grid), which means c and r should always be within their respective bounds. That's why the condition if (c >= 0 && c < 4 && r >= 0 && r < 7) is always true.This condition seems redundant and can be removed. The adjusted part of the code could be as follows:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this code, the condition has been removed and now we directly get the id from the inventory and proceed with the logic to drop items not included in the exception list. The assumption is that inventory is correctly initialized and the indices c and r always fall within the bounds of the inventory array."

If .env does not exist, it will not throw an error due to the || true part. The set -o allexport and set +o allexport commands are used to export all variables defined in these files to the environment of the script.It sets IMAGES_DIR to a directory named images/feh inside the script directory and creates this directory if it does not exist (mkdir -p ""${IMAGES_DIR}"").It changes the current working directory to the images directory (pushd ""${IMAGES_DIR}"").It enters an infinite loop, where it runs feh to display the images in IMAGES_DIR. The -r option is used for recursive image loading, -S mtime for sorting the images by modification time, and -D $SLIDE_DELAY for setting the slide delay to the value of the SLIDE_DELAY environment variable.After running feh, the script waits for one second (sleep 1), and then the loop repeats.The popd commands at the end are used to return to the previous working directories, but these commands are actually never reached due to the infinite loop."

It serves as a backdrop for the icon's foreground layer.The adaptive icon is composed of two layers:Foreground layer: This contains the main visual elements of your icon, which could be your logo or main symbol. This layer is often visually more complex.Background layer: This is the bottom layer, and it sits behind the foreground. It typically features a solid color, gradient, or simple design, providing a backdrop against which the foreground layer stands out.When creating adaptive icons in Android, you can specify separate images or designs for both the foreground and background layers. Android will then animate these two layers independently when the user interacts with the icon.For example, in Image Asset Studio in Android Studio, you can select an image or clip art for the foreground and pick a color for the background.

You can manually inspect the rendered HTML output or use React DevTools to examine the component structure.Adjust Matchers: If the text is not directly present as a single text node, you might need to adjust your query using more flexible matchers. For example, if the text is spread across different elements, you can use a more general query or a custom matcher.Debug with console.log: Insert console.log statements in your test to print out the rendered component or specific elements. This can help you understand how the text is structured and guide you in writing an appropriate query.Visual Inspection: Manually inspect the rendered component to see if the text appears as expected. Look for any conditional rendering that might affect the presence of the text.Handle Asynchronous Operations: Address any asynchronous operations that might be causing the test to hang or fail. Use the --detectOpenHandles flag to identify open asynchronous handles.Check Component and Test Matching: Make sure that you're testing the correct component and that your test is targeting the right elements. Verify that the component you're testing contains the text you're looking for.Mock Data: If the component relies on external data or APIs, provide proper mock data for testing purposes to ensure consistent behavior.Review Jest Configuration: Verify your Jest configuration to ensure that it's set up correctly for testing React components.Check for React Updates: Sometimes, test failures can occur due to changes in React versions or related libraries. Make sure your packages are up to date and compatible with each other.If you can provide more information about the component code, the specific test case that's failing, and any relevant code snippets, I can provide more targeted guidance on how to fix the issue."
"git und github tutorial  | 01, 23",use the words he used to describe things,"Title: A Simple Guide to Git and GitHub, Explained Like You're a Five-Year-OldIntroductionHey kiddos! Today, we're going to learn about two cool things: Git and GitHub. They're like special tools for coding that help you save your progress and share your work with others. Let's break it down nice and easy!What is Git?Alright, so Git is like a magical memory card for your code. Imagine you're playing a video game, and you want to save your progress so that if something bad happens, you can go back to that point. Well, Git does the same thing for your code! It helps you save your changes, like when you add new files or make updates to your code.Here are the basic Git commands you need to know:Initializing a Git repository: When you want to use Git in your project folder, you need to say ""Hey Git, I want you here!"" And you do that by typing git init.Saving your changes: Just like taking a picture of your cool Lego creation, you tell Git, ""Hey, I want to save this!"" You can do that with the command git add . or git add filename if you want to save specific files.Committing changes: Now, it's like giving your saved picture a name. When you save, you have to say what you did, so you use git commit -m ""your message"" to tell Git what changes you made.Viewing commit history: Git keeps track of all your saved pictures, and you can look at them later. You use git log to see a list of all your saved changes.What is GitHub?Now, let's talk about GitHub. It's like a special website where you can show off your cool Lego creations to everyone! You can share your code, work with others, and see what they're building too.Here's how you use GitHub:Create a GitHub profile: First, you need to make a special profile on GitHub, just like signing up for a new game.Create a new repository: It's like making a new folder for your Lego creations. You follow the instructions on the website to do that.Connect your local project to GitHub: Now, you need to link your cool Lego folder on your computer to GitHub. You do that by typing git remote add origin <repository_url>.Share your code: Once you've made some cool changes and saved them with Git, you can push your code to GitHub using git push origin master.Collaborating on GitHub:Branches: Think of branches as making your own special copies of your Lego creations. You can work on new stuff without messing up the original. To create a branch, say ""I want a new copy!"" with git checkout -b branch_name.Merging: When you're done working on your new stuff, you might want to combine it with the original Lego creation. That's called merging, and you can do it with a pull request.Pulling changes: If someone else made cool changes to the original Lego creation on GitHub, you can pull those changes to your own project using git pull origin master.ConclusionSo, there you have it, little buddies! Git is like a memory card that saves your code changes, and GitHub is like a special website where you can show off your coding creations and work with others. Remember, just like with Lego, practice makes perfect, so keep coding and exploring the world of Git and GitHub! Happy coding, little champs!"
"Add code from ChatGPT | 02, 21",Can I get a performance improvement by linking instead of copying the images?,"Yes, creating symbolic links (also known as ""symlinks"") instead of copying files can improve performance and save disk space. Copying files is a relatively slow operation that involves reading the entire contents of the original file and writing it to a new location. By contrast, creating a symbolic link is a quick operation that simply creates a new directory entry pointing to the existing file. This operation is nearly instantaneous, regardless of the size of the original file.In the context of your script, using symbolic links means that the slideshow will display faster when it's initially started, especially if there are many large images to display.Here's how you can modify the script to use symbolic links:[CODE_BLOCK_0]This script works the same as the previous one, but it creates symbolic links in the temporary directory instead of copying the images. The ln -s command is used to create the symbolic links.Remember to replace /path/to/your/directory with the path to your images and replace tag1, tag2, tag3 with the tags you want to allow."

This is because the node_modules directory is typically excluded from being mounted for performance reasons, as it's managed by the npm packages installed in the Docker image.The container_name property assigns a custom name to the container for better identification.Make sure to place the Dockerfile for the frontend in the frontend directory. This Dockerfile should contain the instructions to build the frontend React application."

If you place this code in an __init__.py file within a directory, it will effectively allow you to import modules from the parent directory of that directory.Use of sys.path.append():
Using sys.path.append() to modify the Python path can work, but it's generally not recommended for production code. Modifying sys.path in your code can make it less clear where modules are being imported from, and it might lead to unintended side effects.Best Practice: Using Proper Imports:
Instead of modifying the Python path, it's a better practice to structure your project in a way that avoids the need to modify sys.path. You should use relative imports and make sure your project's directory structure supports the desired module organization.Virtual Environments:
If you're using virtual environments (which is highly recommended), you don't usually need to modify sys.path. Virtual environments isolate your project's dependencies, making it unnecessary to manually manipulate the path.Packages:
If you're building a package with multiple modules, it's better to structure your code as a package and use proper relative imports. This will improve code organization and readability.Remember that clean and organized code is essential for maintainability, and using relative imports and structuring your code well will contribute to that. If you find yourself needing to modify the Python path frequently, it's a sign that there might be a better way to organize your code or use packages and modules effectively."

Look for more detailed error messages or stack traces that can provide insights into the specific error that occurred.Mangum Configuration: Double-check your Mangum application setup and configuration. Ensure that you have properly defined the Mangum app instance and configured it to work with your FastAPI application.Dependencies: Verify that all the required dependencies are correctly installed and properly configured within your Lambda function environment. Ensure that you are using compatible versions of Mangum and other dependencies.FastAPI Application: Make sure your FastAPI application is correctly structured and follows the required conventions. Ensure that the routes, request handling, and response generation are properly implemented.Exception Handling: Implement proper exception handling within your FastAPI application. Catch and handle exceptions where appropriate, and provide meaningful error messages to help diagnose issues.Memory and Timeout: If your Lambda function is running out of memory or experiencing timeouts, it could lead to errors. Ensure that your function's memory allocation and timeout settings are appropriate.Testing: Test your Mangum application in a local environment or on a non-Lambda platform to ensure that it works as expected outside of the Lambda environment.Documentation and Examples: Review the documentation and example code provided by Mangum and FastAPI to ensure that you are following best practices and using the framework correctly.Lambda Configuration: Double-check the Lambda function's runtime configuration, such as environment variables, execution role, and permissions, to ensure that everything is correctly set up.Rollback and Incremental Changes: If you made recent changes to your code, try reverting those changes and deploying a known working version. Then, incrementally reintroduce changes to identify the specific change that caused the error.External Services: If your application interacts with external services or APIs, ensure they are operational and properly configured.Resource Limits: Check if you are hitting any resource limits imposed by AWS Lambda, such as the maximum size of the deployment package or the number of open files.By carefully reviewing the logs, checking your configuration, and verifying the integration between Mangum and FastAPI, you should be able to identify the cause of the error and take appropriate steps to resolve it."

For that, you might need a more advanced slideshow software. There are other tools like imagemagick that can do these effects, but they cannot be incorporated into a real-time slideshow as easily.Please note that this script assumes that the images are being saved with their capture time as the file's modification time. If your camera is saving the capture time in the file's EXIF data, then you would need to use a tool like jhead to adjust the file's modification time to match the capture time before running the script."

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this

If you're looking to serve your React frontend using an NGINX server in a production environment, you can modify the Dockerfile as follows:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Explanation:The build-stage section is responsible for building the React app using Node.js. It copies the package.json files, installs dependencies, copies your app's source code, and then builds the app using npm run build.The nginx section uses an official NGINX runtime as the base image. It copies the build files from the build-stage container's /usr/src/app/build directory to NGINX's default serving directory /usr/share/nginx/html.The EXPOSE command exposes port 80, which is the default port for serving HTTP traffic.The CMD command starts the NGINX server with the daemon off; configuration to keep it running in the foreground.This Dockerfile will build an image that serves your React app using an NGINX server in a production-ready manner.

In this case, you might want to consider filtering or controlling the logging output to only display the relevant information.To control the logging behavior in your tests, you can use the built-in logging module provided by Python. You can adjust the logging level and configure the output format to control what gets printed to the console.Here's an example of how you can configure logging to only show messages at or above a certain level:[CODE_BLOCK_0]You can place this code at the beginning of your test script or in a separate conftest.py file if you have one.Additionally, if you're using external libraries that generate logs, you might need to configure their logging separately to control their output.Remember that using logging instead of print statements is generally a better practice, as it allows you to control the output more effectively and provides more flexibility for debugging and production environments."

"Automation & Testing | 107, 22",what does codeql analysis do?,"CodeQL analysis is a static code analysis tool provided by GitHub that helps identify and prevent security vulnerabilities in your codebase. It goes beyond traditional static analysis by allowing you to write custom queries to analyze your code for security vulnerabilities, data leaks, and other code quality issues. CodeQL is capable of analyzing a wide variety of programming languages and can help you find security vulnerabilities such as:Code Vulnerabilities: CodeQL can help identify known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries or components that you might be using in your project.Data Leaks: It can detect code that might unintentionally expose sensitive information or data.Code Quality Issues: CodeQL can find coding patterns that could lead to bugs or security vulnerabilities, such as unhandled exceptions or potential null pointer dereferences.Security Misconfigurations: It can detect misconfigurations or issues in security-sensitive areas of your code, like authentication and authorization.Taint Analysis: CodeQL can track how potentially tainted data (e.g., user inputs) flows through your code, helping you identify places where it might be misused or where injections might occur.The power of CodeQL comes from its query language, which allows you to express complex patterns of code behavior to identify potential issues. You can also benefit from the CodeQL community, which shares queries and best practices for detecting specific types of vulnerabilities.CodeQL can be integrated into your GitHub repository's workflow using GitHub Actions, allowing you to automatically run CodeQL analysis whenever code changes are pushed to your repository. This helps in catching security vulnerabilities early in the development process and maintaining a more secure codebase.Keep in mind that CodeQL analysis does have a learning curve, especially when writing custom queries. However, it can significantly enhance the security of your software projects by identifying security vulnerabilities and code quality issues that might not be easily caught through manual code review."

"Github Actions とpre-commitにpoetry exportを適用 | 03, 146",ユーザーに追加の手順を要求しない方法を教えてください。,ユーザーに追加の手順を要求せずに、異なる環境で動作するスクリプトを作成するための一つの方法は、プラットフォームに依存しないプログラミング言語を使用することです。しかし、それでもランタイムが必要な言語（Python、Node.jsなど）は問題となります。そのため、一つの解決策は、プラットフォームに依存しない、かつランタイムが不要な言語でスクリプトを書くことです。そのような言語の一つがGo言語です。Goはクロスコンパイルが可能で、一度コンパイルされたバイナリはランタイムなしで動作します。つまり、Goで書かれたプログラムは、それがコンパイルされたプラットフォーム（Windows、Linux、Macなど）で直接実行することができます。以下に、Goで書かれたpre-commitフックの例を示します：[CODE_BLOCK_0]このスクリプトはGoのテストを実行し、テストが失敗した場合はエラーメッセージを出力して終了コード1で終了します。このスクリプトはGoで書かれていますが、go buildを使ってバイナリにコンパイルすることができます。そして、そのバイナリはGoのランタイムなしで実行することができます。ただし、このアプローチにはいくつかの欠点があります。第一に、スクリプトをGoで書く必要があります。第二に、バイナリは各プラットフォームごとにコンパイルする必要があります。第三に、バイナリはソースコードと比べて大きなサイズになる可能性があります。

"Automation & Testing | 122, 22",this is not supported,"I apologize for any confusion. It seems that setting working-directory for a step that uses an action (actions/setup-node@v3 in this case) is not supported directly in GitHub Actions.To work around this limitation, you can use the working-directory field provided by the action itself, if it supports it. If not, you might need to split the steps into two separate steps: one for setting up the Node.js environment in the desired working directory and another for installing dependencies and building.Here's an example using this approach:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this example, the cd command is used to navigate to the frontend directory before executing the relevant steps.

Hi there,

this is to invite you to participate in Banzuke Surfing in the upcoming basho.
The rules are very simple.

Banzuke Surfing is run in several waves, with a new wave starting every year.

The goal is to move up the banzuke as far and fast as possible. You do so by temporarily ""adopting"" one or more rikishi at a given banzuke position. If your rikishi moves up the banzuke, so will you, if the rikishi moves down by getting MK, so will you (at least, if all your picked rikishi move down). If your rikishi goes intai, you will get his last position next time. In the basho after the current one you will be taking the banzuke position of the best-placed rikishi you've picked this time.

If your name appears on the list below, you have already participated. The column ""Allowed Picks"" shows you which rikishi of the banzuke you are allowed to pick next basho. If you are participating for the first time, you are allowed to pick any of the rikishi in the bottom 32 of the banzuke (as indicated below).
The rikishi that you are allowed to pick are all rikishi below your last (or most successful) pick. So generally, you cannot pick the same rikishi twice. An exception is if your rikishi drops into the last 32 of the banzuke or goes banzuke-gai. In this case, of course, you can pick any of the bottom 32 rikishi (just like a new player).

During your entire career of a given wave you can use up to three so-called jokers (indicated by the number of asterisks behind your name). In addition to the regular rikishi you pick for a basho, you can use one joker if still available. The more successful one of these two will determine your new banzuke position.

Deadline is shonichi 8 AM JST.

All new players are allowed to pick Jk6w Sawaisamu and below.

However, as a text-based AI, I can't actually build the web interface. You may need a web developer to bring this vision to life.Here's an idea for the layout and functionality of the web interface:HomepageThe homepage provides a brief description of the Banzuke Surfing game. It provides users with the option to ""Start Playing"" (for new users) or ""Continue Playing"" (for returning users).Start Playing PageNew players are directed to the ""Start Playing"" page, which contains a dropdown list of the bottom 32 rikishi they can choose from. The player selects their preferred rikishi and clicks on the ""Start Playing"" button to confirm their choice. They also have the option to use up to three jokers during their gameplay.Continue Playing PageReturning players are directed to the ""Continue Playing"" page. This page displays a table similar to the one provided in your text. It shows each player's name, their last picked surfer, their position, and their allowed picks for the next round. The player can make their pick for the next round from a dropdown list. They also have the option to use a joker, if any are left.The ""Continue Playing"" page also has a button for the player to confirm their pick and submit their choices. Once the player makes a pick, their position and allowed picks are updated accordingly.Leaderboard PageA leaderboard is available that shows the rank, player name, last surfer picked, and their current position. This page is updated after each round.Rules and Help PageThis page contains detailed rules of the game. It explains the terms used in the game, such as rikishi, banzuke, basho, jokers, and more. It also provides tips and strategies to help players move up in the rankings.Account ManagementEach player should be able to create an account to participate in the game. This account would keep track of their history, including past picks and their progression over time. It would also manage their jokers usage.I hope this gives you a good starting point to create an engaging web interface for the Banzuke Surfing game. If you have specific features in mind, please let me know, and I can incorporate them into the design."

If get_album_names is defined in the environment of the calling script or in one of the sourced files (.env or .config), that's fine. Otherwise, you'll get an error when you try to run your script.Make sure to source the script (. script.sh or source script.sh) rather than execute it (./script.sh). If you execute the script, it will run in a separate process and its variables won't affect the calling environment."

Error: Process completed with exit code 123.

Don't know what formatting is required here 
as the files are already well formatted

","The error you're encountering with the black command indicates that the files would be reformatted, but you mentioned that the files are already well formatted and don't need any changes. This situation might occur if the formatting style defined by black is different from the current formatting style of your code.In this case, since you're confident that the files are already well formatted and you don't want black to make any changes, you can modify the black command to run with the --check flag alone. This flag will perform a check for formatting issues but won't actually make any changes to the files. If the check passes, it means that your code is already in compliance with black's formatting rules.Here's how you can modify the command:[CODE_BLOCK_0]This modified command will perform a check for formatting issues using black without attempting to make any changes. If the check passes without any output, it means your code is already well formatted according to black's rules."
"Automation & Testing | 142, 22",does tests folder need an init file?,"In Python, the presence of an __init__.py file in a directory indicates that the directory should be treated as a Python package. This is important for the Python interpreter to recognize the directory as a module and allow you to import modules from within it.For a test folder, it's not strictly necessary to have an __init__.py file unless you plan to treat it as a package and import modules from it. However, having an empty __init__.py file in the tests folder is a common convention. It's useful in case you decide to organize your tests into subdirectories or add common utilities for your tests in the future. It also helps to make it clear that the folder is intentionally part of your project's structure.So, while not strictly required, adding an empty __init__.py file to your tests folder is generally a good practice."
"Automation & Testing | 82, 22",What about customisabel black formatterargs,"Certainly, you can customize the black formatter arguments in your VSCode settings. Here's how you can do that:In your VSCode settings, you can specify the custom black formatter arguments by modifying the ""black-formatter.args"" array. Here's an example of how you can include custom arguments:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In the example above, the ""black-formatter.args"" array includes custom arguments such as --line-length to set a specific line length, --exclude to exclude certain directories from formatting (in this case, venv), and --skip-string-normalization to skip normalizing string quotes.You can adjust these custom arguments according to your preferences and project requirements. Remember that black provides a variety of arguments that allow you to configure its behavior according to your coding style and needs."

"Refactor: api call 함수 및 webSocket 리팩토링 | 05, 10",async/await를 사용하지 않고 .then()/.catch() api를 써도 promise 객체를 반환하는건 똑같지 않아? 아닌가?,"네, 맞습니다. async/await와 .then()/.catch() 모두 Promise 객체를 다루는 두 가지 다른 방식일 뿐, 내부적으로는 Promise를 반환하게 됩니다.async/await는 비동기 코드를 보다 동기적으로 작성할 수 있도록 하는 문법적인 도구입니다. async 함수 내에서 await를 사용하면 비동기 작업의 결과를 기다린 후에 다음 작업을 처리할 수 있게 되며, await 표현식은 자동으로 해당 Promise가 resolve될 때까지 기다리게 됩니다.반면에 .then() 및 .catch()를 사용하면 비동기 작업의 결과를 콜백 함수를 통해 처리합니다. 이 역시도 Promise 객체의 상태 변화를 다루는 것으로, .then()은 Promise가 resolve된 경우에, .catch()는 Promise가 reject된 경우에 호출됩니다.둘 중 어느 방식을 사용하더라도 Promise 객체의 결과를 다루며, 결국엔 비동기 작업의 결과를 처리하는 방법에 차이가 있을 뿐입니다. 코드의 가독성과 유지 보수성을 고려하여 async/await나 .then()/.catch() 중 더 편리하다고 생각되는 방식을 사용하시면 됩니다."

}","Thank you for providing the event JSON. The issue seems to be that the body field is nested within another body object in the event JSON. This is causing the mangum adapter to treat the inner body as a dictionary instead of a base64-encoded string.To resolve this, you should structure the body field directly as a base64-encoded string representing your JSON payload. Here's the corrected test_event.json:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Replace ""eyJlbWFpbF9wc...your_base64_encoded_json_here..."" with the actual base64-encoded representation of the JSON you want to send as the request body.Make sure the isBase64Encoded field is set to true and that the body field directly contains the base64-encoded JSON string.Once you have the correct format for the test_event.json, try running the python-lambda-local command again with this updated event.

"Automation & Testing | 104, 22",is it a good practice to separate different github action workflows in dirs,"Yes, it can be a good practice to organize different GitHub Actions workflows into separate directories, especially when you have multiple workflows for different parts of your project or for different purposes. Organizing workflows in directories can help keep your repository's root directory clean and make it easier to locate specific workflows when needed.Here are some benefits of organizing workflows into separate directories:Clarity: Each workflow's purpose is clear from the directory name, making it easier for contributors to understand the purpose of each workflow.Modularity: Workflows for different parts of the project can be managed and updated independently, reducing the chances of conflicts or unexpected interactions between workflows.Ease of Maintenance: When workflows are grouped together based on their related tasks, it's easier to make changes or updates to a specific set of workflows.Readability: With separate directories, you can include additional documentation, configuration files, or other resources specific to each set of workflows, enhancing readability and organization.Scalability: As your project grows, having separate directories for workflows makes it easier to manage and maintain a larger number of workflows.For example, you might organize your workflows like this:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this structure, each directory contains workflows related to a specific set of tasks (linting and formatting, deployment, etc.), making it easy to manage and understand the purpose of each workflow.Ultimately, the organization should align with your project's needs and the complexity of your workflows. It's important to strike a balance between organization and simplicity, ensuring that contributors can easily locate and understand the workflows while avoiding excessive complexity."
"Automation & Testing | 126, 22",how to run a workflow from a different branch,"To run a workflow from a different branch in GitHub Actions, you can use the GitHub API to trigger a workflow_dispatch event on that specific branch. Here's how you can do it:Create a Personal Access Token (PAT) on GitHub:Go to your GitHub account settings.Navigate to ""Developer settings"" > ""Personal access tokens"".Click on ""Generate new token"" and select the necessary scopes (e.g., repo).Generate the token and keep it secure.Use the GitHub API to trigger the workflow:
You can use tools like curl or Postman, or even run this in a GitHub Actions workflow itself. Here's an example using curl:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Replace the placeholders with your actual information:YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN: The personal access token you generated.USERNAME: Your GitHub username.REPO_NAME: The name of the repository.WORKFLOW_FILE_PATH: The path to the workflow file in the repository.BRANCH_NAME: The name of the branch you want to trigger the workflow on.This will trigger the workflow_dispatch event on the specified branch, and the workflow will run based on the configuration you've set in your workflow file.Remember to keep your personal access token secure and avoid exposing it in public places. You can also use repository secrets in GitHub to securely store and use your access token within your workflow."
