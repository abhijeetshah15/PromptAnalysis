"Improved UX and Security: Switching to Time-based One Time Passwords (TOTPs)! | 11, 12","For point 3, I could make the identifier be equal to the User ID. But that may be a bit ambiguous which makes me think bringing back the relational model for the `type` field would be useful. Which approach do you think strikes the best balance between complexity and flexibility?","Having the identifier field equal to the User ID for certain verification types would indeed provide some flexibility, but as you noted, it might introduce ambiguity. The identifier field could contain either an email or a User ID depending on context, which could make the data harder to interpret and potentially lead to errors.Bringing back the type field would provide clarity and would allow you to handle different types of verification each with their own distinct requirements. Although it introduces a bit more complexity, it could provide more flexibility in the long run and help avoid potential confusion.Here's how you might revise the schema to include the type field:[CODE_BLOCK_0]With this setup, you have the type field to differentiate between different types of verifications, and the identifier field to hold the value being verified, which could be an email or a User ID depending on the verification type.This strikes a good balance between complexity and flexibility. You are keeping your data model simple and understandable, while also making it flexible enough to accommodate a variety of verification scenarios. The type field provides a clear indication of how to interpret the identifier field and how to handle each verification entry."

"Improved UX and Security: Switching to Time-based One Time Passwords (TOTPs)! | 15, 12",What are the drawbacks of having more than one combination of verificationTarget and type?,"If you have more than one combination of verificationTarget and type, it means you have multiple verification records for the same target. This could cause several potential issues:Confusion for users: If a user receives multiple emails with different verification codes, they might not know which one to use. This could lead to a poor user experience.Potential for misuse: If there are multiple active verifications for the same target, a malicious actor could potentially exploit this to try and verify an email address or account that doesn't belong to them.Increased system complexity: Managing multiple verifications for the same target increases the complexity of your system. You would need to decide how to handle cases where multiple verifications exist: Should the old one be invalidated when a new one is created? Should all be valid until used or expired? These additional edge cases could make your code more complex and difficult to maintain.Performance impact: If you have a large number of redundant verification records, it could increase the size of your database and potentially impact performance. This would be more of a concern for very large systems, but it's still worth considering.For these reasons, it's usually a good idea to enforce uniqueness for the combination of verificationTarget and type. This ensures that for any given type of verification, a particular target can only have one active verification at a time."
"Improved UX and Security: Switching to Time-based One Time Passwords (TOTPs)! | 25, 12","Can you expand on the possible brute-force attack vulnerability of the env var secret? Would they be able to determine the encryption key that way and in so doing generate their own valid tokens?

Also, if an attacker were able to gain access to my server environment, they would be able to access the SQLite database as well which means they could do much worse things than impersonate a user, so unless I'm missing something, that point is not a good argument against keeping things as they are.","Sure, I can provide a little more insight into these topics.Brute-Force Attack Vulnerability
The use of a shared encryption key in your environment variable means that every single token is encrypted and decrypted with the same key. If an attacker manages to intercept one of these tokens (for instance, via email), they could potentially try to brute force the encryption by trying different encryption keys until they find the one that decrypts the token correctly. This is admittedly a huge undertaking, requiring significant computational resources and time.However, it is also theoretically possible. With enough computational power, an attacker could gradually guess at your secret key until they arrive at the correct one. Once they have that key, they could generate valid tokens at will, thereby impersonating any user.As computational power increases and becomes cheaper to access (think cloud computing and GPUs), the feasibility of such brute-force attacks increases. That said, the likelihood of such an attack happening depends on your specific threat model, including who might want to attack you and what resources they have at their disposal.Server Environment Access
You are correct in your assessment. If an attacker has access to your server environment, you have bigger problems than just token forgery. They could do a lot more damage, including directly accessing your database, manipulating your data, or even taking over your entire system.The point here is that relying solely on a single shared secret in an environment variable for security introduces a single point of failure. If that secret is compromised, the entire security of your user authentication process is compromised. By having individualized secret keys for each user stored in a database, you distribute the risk. If one key is compromised, it doesn't endanger the rest of your user base.However, as you rightly pointed out, if the attacker has gained access to your server, they could potentially access your database and retrieve all the secret keys anyway, rendering the distributed risk point moot.It's a complex situation with a lot of variables, and your ultimate decision will depend on your specific circumstances and your evaluation of the risks and benefits. The most important thing is that you're considering these questions carefully and taking steps to protect your system and your users to the best of your ability."
"Improved UX and Security: Switching to Time-based One Time Passwords (TOTPs)! | 24, 12",I'm still feeling uncertain. It seems like I'm giving up the simplicity of having an environment variable which I need to keep secret and a couple very simple TS methods in favor of a database table and a more complex verification process. All because I'm vulnerable to the environment variable leaking. The only situation where the environment variable could leak is if someone gains access to my VM which would actually open me up to a lot worse problems either way anyway. I'm just starting to think this is unnecessary work to change. Please weigh the options.,"You are correct in your assessment, and I understand your concerns. You're facing a trade-off between security and simplicity. The choice really depends on your specific use case, threat model, and your tolerance for risk. Let me break down the arguments for each side:Sticking with the existing setup (shared secret in environment variable):Advantages:Simplicity: It's straightforward to implement and understand. There's no need to manage a separate table in your database.No additional dependencies: The logic required to encrypt/decrypt tokens can be written with built-in Node.js libraries.Drawbacks:Security: If an attacker gains access to your server environment, they could retrieve the encryption key. This could then be used to generate valid tokens, allowing them to impersonate any user.Brute-force attacks: Although it would take significant computational power, an attacker could attempt to brute force your encryption given enough time and resources.Switching to the new setup (using TOTP and storing tokens in the database):Advantages:Security: Each user has their own secret key, reducing the impact if one user's key is compromised. Furthermore, even if the verification table is breached, the attacker would only be able to impersonate users whose verification has not yet expired, which is typically a small window.Protection against brute-force attacks: TOTP is resistant to brute force attacks because each OTP is valid for only a short period of time.Drawbacks:Complexity: The setup is more complicated, requiring additional database tables and more sophisticated logic in your server code.Additional dependencies: You would likely rely on external libraries for generating and validating TOTPs, adding potential points of failure.In conclusion, if you are willing to accept the risk associated with a shared secret and you trust your server's security measures, keeping your current setup may make sense, especially if the simplicity and fewer dependencies are appealing to you. However, if you want to follow best security practices and minimize potential risks, implementing the TOTP approach would be a better choice.Remember, no security measure is perfect, and the best solution is often a balance between security, complexity, and usability. You know your application, your users, and your resources better than anyone else, so the final decision is up to you."
"Improved UX and Security: Switching to Time-based One Time Passwords (TOTPs)! | 23, 12","Ok, that's fine. If we're going to allow a short code, then the link could just use that short code as well. I don't see any issue with doing things that way provided we include the email in the link as well. So maybe the link could be something like: `https://example.com/verify?code=12345&email=me%40example.com`.","Absolutely, you can certainly use the OTP as a part of the magic link and it would definitely work. Just remember to URL-encode the email address when you insert it into the URL, and decode it when you read it back, to ensure that any special characters don't cause problems.Here is a simple way to implement it:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In the createVerification function, we are returning a URL string, which includes the email and OTP. When the user clicks the link or manually inputs the OTP, you can use the verifyOtp function to validate it."
"Improved UX and Security: Switching to Time-based One Time Passwords (TOTPs)! | 29, 12",Why would I care to enforce uniqueness?,"In the context of OTPs, enforcing uniqueness is not typically necessary. OTPs are usually intended to be used once and then expire, and are generally associated with a particular user or session. In fact, because OTPs are typically generated randomly, it's actually expected that occasionally you might have two identical OTPs in use at the same time for two different users or sessions.The unique constraint on the OTP in the database schema would only be useful in the unlikely event that you want to ensure that no two users could ever have the same OTP at the same time. This is not usually necessary, and in fact could be problematic, as it would potentially prevent a new OTP from being generated if it happened to collide with an existing one.Unless you have a specific need to ensure that all OTPs are globally unique, you can remove the unique constraint from the OTP field in the database schema."
"Improved UX and Security: Switching to Time-based One Time Passwords (TOTPs)! | 17, 12","Good arguments. I think I'll keep it in the main database.

Could you please write the module that uses prisma and manages creating and verifying TOTPs and handle edge cases where a second verification is created for the same type and target.","Sure, below is a simple module that uses Prisma and the notp library to create and verify TOTPs. Note that the below module assumes you have already setup Prisma and notp, and have imported them correctly.[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this module, the createTOTP function first deletes any existing verification records for the same verificationTarget and type, and then creates a new verification record with a generated OTP and calculated expiration time.The verifyTOTP function fetches the verification record for the given verificationTarget and type, checks if the OTP is valid and not expired, and if so, deletes the verification record. Note that the function throws an error if the verification record does not exist, if the OTP is invalid, or if the OTP has expired.Please replace the generateSecretKey and calculateExpirationTime placeholder functions with your actual implementation. These functions generate a secret key for the TOTP and calculate the expiration time, respectively.I hope this helps! If you have any questions, please let me know."
"Improved UX and Security: Switching to Time-based One Time Passwords (TOTPs)! | 10, 12","Would it be reasonable for me to disassociate the verification model from the user? In the case of registration, I don't have a user yet. I'm thinking for registration I could just lookup the verification by the otp which would then allow me to create a new user by the identifier (which would be the email). Would doing this limit the usefulness of this model?","Yes, it's reasonable to disassociate the Verification model from the User if you want to use it for situations like registration where you don't have a user yet. However, you may want to consider how you'll handle the situation where a user is created, but not yet verified. This is where having a relationship between User and Verification could be helpful.In your suggested scenario, you would generate an OTP and email it to the user during the registration process, then, when the user verifies their email, you would look up the Verification entry by the OTP, retrieve the identifier (email), and create a new user with that email.Here's how your models might look in Prisma with the relationship removed:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Please keep in mind, with this approach, there are a few potential issues you'll need to handle:If a user initiates the registration process multiple times with the same email before verifying, you'll need to handle the possibility of multiple Verification entries for the same email.You'll need to handle cleanup of Verification entries once they're no longer needed.If you later want to add a feature that requires knowing which User a Verification is associated with (such as two-factor authentication), you may need to re-introduce the relationship between the two models.So while it does give you the flexibility to handle registration in the manner you described, it might complicate some future developments and add a bit of overhead for handling the above cases. But overall, it should not limit the usefulness of the model in a significant way."
"Improved UX and Security: Switching to Time-based One Time Passwords (TOTPs)! | 02, 12",Thanks. Please tell me more about TOTP solutions in a typical Node.js server setting.,"Sure! There are a number of good libraries for implementing TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) in Node.js. The most commonly used one is probably speakeasy.Here's a simple example of how you might use it:First, install the library with npm:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Then, you can generate a secret for a user:[CODE_BLOCK_1]When it's time to authenticate the user, you can generate a token and check it against the user's input:[CODE_BLOCK_2]Remember that TOTP tokens are only valid for a short period of time (usually 30 seconds). So if the time on your server is significantly different from the time on your user's device, verification might fail. If you're running into problems, you might want to consider using a NTP (Network Time Protocol) library to synchronize your server's time.To use this in a real-world scenario, you would need to securely store each user's secret (ideally in a hashed form), generate a token when the user initiates an authentication request, and verify the token when the user submits it.For added security, you might want to consider using a library like authenticator to generate QR codes that users can scan with an app like Google Authenticator. This would save them having to manually type in their secret.As always, remember that security is a complex field and there are many factors to consider when implementing any form of authentication. It's a good idea to do a thorough review of your system, possibly with the help of a security expert, before deploying it."
"Is there any way to persist tab suspension across browser restarts? | 02, 17","I want to develop an extension that needs to keep track of all tabs, even when browser restarts. 

The tabs shouldn't be identified only by URL as a session may have many tabs with same URL","If you want to keep track of all tabs, even across browser restarts, and you don't want to rely solely on URLs for identification, you can use a combination of techniques to achieve this:Persistent Storage: Utilize the chrome.storage API to store information about the tabs. This API allows you to store data that persists even after the browser is restarted. You can store tab-related information along with a unique identifier for each tab.Unique Tab Identifier: Generate a unique identifier for each tab in your extension. You can assign a unique ID to each tab when it is created or when your extension is first installed. You can use techniques like UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers) or other algorithms to ensure uniqueness.Event Listeners: Use event listeners such as chrome.tabs.onCreated, chrome.tabs.onUpdated, and chrome.tabs.onRemoved to track tab creation, updates, and removal. When a tab is created, updated, or removed, you can store or update the relevant information in the persistent storage along with the unique tab identifier.By combining these techniques, you can maintain a persistent record of all tabs in your extension, even across browser restarts. You can retrieve the stored tab information and use the unique tab identifier to identify and track tabs reliably."
"Improved UX and Security: Switching to Time-based One Time Passwords (TOTPs)! | 06, 12","> Here, we're using the same key for all users, which is not secure.

Could you elaborate on this point? I would like to avoid creating a table for this if possible. So I was thinking of generating a random key and setting that as an environment variable which every one of these uses. Why would that be a problem with this?","Using the same secret key for all users could pose a security risk. Here's why:The secret key is essentially the seed for the one-time password generation. If you're using the same secret key for all users, then the OTP generated at any given time will be the same for all users. This means that if an attacker manages to intercept or otherwise acquire a valid OTP, they could potentially use it to impersonate any user.Additionally, if the shared secret key were to be compromised (e.g., if an attacker gained access to your environment variables), they would be able to generate valid OTPs for any user. In contrast, if each user has a unique secret key, an attacker who compromises one key would only be able to impersonate that one user.That said, there may be scenarios where a shared key might be acceptable, depending on the specifics of your application and threat model. For example, if you're generating OTPs that are only used once and then immediately expired, and you have other layers of security in place, it might be less of a risk.However, it's generally considered best practice to use unique keys for each user to minimize the potential impact of a key being compromised.If you're looking to avoid creating a database table, one possibility might be to derive a unique secret key for each user based on some other unique attribute of the user (like their user ID or email), combined with a master key stored as an environment variable. But this has its own potential issues (for instance, you would need to handle key derivation securely), and in general it's still advisable to store per-user secret keys in a secure manner, which typically means a dedicated database table."
"Improved UX and Security: Switching to Time-based One Time Passwords (TOTPs)! | 01, 12","Thanks. A few follow-ups:

- For option 1, I hadn't considered this. Thwarting precomputed dictionary attacks is my primary objective, because it's the main vulnerability I'm trying to fix. Are there other vulnerabilities I should be concerned about? This option doesn't seem any more complicated to implement or maintain than option 2 and that feels safer. Is it?
- For option 2, I think I prefer this option. Are there other considerations I should keep in mind?
- For option 3, I could avoid writing to the database if I put the value of the salt in a cookie. The attacker would still have access to it if they submitted it themselves, but they wouldn't have access to the salt if they hacked into people's emails. However, this has the drawback of the user being unable to sign in from a different browser from the one that requested the token which I've already experienced in another app as something people complain about. So is the concern about someone hacking into people's emails all that valid in a practical scenario?
- For option 4, Wouldn't another downside of the JWT token approach be that it is vulnerable to rainbow tables as well?
- This sounds like a pretty good solution. Would it be reasonable to use a TOTP both as something I display for people to type as well as a query param in the magic link? Are TOTPs too long to expect a user to type? Keep in mind they may not be able to copy/paste because they may be using a different device to look at the email from the one they're typing into.","Option 1: This is a simple and effective approach for thwarting precomputed dictionary attacks, but keep in mind it is only as secure as the hash function you use. Since the salt isn't secret, a potential attacker could still make an offline attack if they get hold of your hashed data and know your algorithm. However, if you're using a strong encryption algorithm and a sufficiently complex key, this should be difficult.Option 2: There's not much difference in terms of security between options 1 and 2, but option 2 may be a bit simpler to implement. The main consideration here is that the salt should be randomly generated and sufficiently long to make guessing it impractical. Also, you should make sure that the generated links are only valid for a limited period of time to prevent their reuse if they are intercepted or leaked.Option 3: Putting the salt in a cookie would mean that it is tied to a specific browser, which could be inconvenient for users as you've noted. The risk of someone hacking into people's emails varies depending on the sensitivity of the data your app is handling. For most consumer applications, it's probably not a high risk, but it's not nonexistent either. If you're dealing with highly sensitive data, you might want to consider a more secure approach.Option 4: JWT tokens are signed but not encrypted by default, meaning the payload data can be read by anyone who intercepts the token. If an attacker has the secret key, they can forge tokens, which would be a problem. The key here is to keep the secret key secure. As for rainbow table attacks, they're more applicable to hashed values (like password hashes), not signed tokens like JWT. As long as you use a strong, secure secret key, rainbow attacks aren't really a concern for JWTs.Option 5: TOTP is a good solution, especially because it naturally prevents reuse of the code. However, typical TOTP codes are 6 digits long, which might be a bit long for users to type without errors. It could work in the query param for a magic link, but again, you would need to ensure that the magic link is used within a limited time frame. In practice, many services send TOTP codes via SMS or through an authenticator app. Remember, TOTP requires a shared secret between the server and the client. This secret must be securely stored and kept confidential, which might present its own challenges.Remember, security is all about trade-offs. Consider the sensitivity of the data you're protecting and the risks associated with different methods, and choose the method that provides an appropriate level of security for your specific situation."
"Improved UX and Security: Switching to Time-based One Time Passwords (TOTPs)! | 04, 12","To be clear, I'm fine using built-in Node.js libraries like the crypto module. Is this still pretty challenging?","Using built-in Node.js libraries like crypto does make implementing TOTP easier, but it's still a bit involved. Here's a rough outline of how you might implement TOTP using Node.js's built-in libraries:Generate a Secret Key: You can use the crypto.randomBytes function to generate a secure random key.[CODE_BLOCK_0]Generate the TOTP: This is where most of the complexity lies. The process includes:Getting the current Unix time and dividing it by the time step (typically 30 seconds).Converting this value to a buffer.Generating an HMAC-SHA1 hash of this buffer, using the secret key.Converting this hash into a 6-digit number.Here's how you might do it:[CODE_BLOCK_1]Validate the TOTP: You would use the same function to generate the TOTP when the user provides their code. Compare the provided code with the generated code. If they match, the code is valid.Keep in mind that this is a very simplified version of a TOTP generator and might not work correctly in all situations. It also doesn't handle error conditions, time synchronization issues, etc. If you decide to implement TOTP this way, you should thoroughly test your implementation and possibly have it reviewed by a security expert."
"Is there any way to persist tab suspension across browser restarts? | 08, 17",What tab properties can I normally read browsers' APIs?,"The tab properties that you can typically read using browsers' extension APIs include:id: A unique identifier assigned to each tab.url: The URL of the tab's current webpage.title: The title of the tab's current webpage.index: The position of the tab within its window.pinned: Indicates whether the tab is pinned or not.active: Indicates whether the tab is currently active or not.favIconUrl: The URL of the tab's favicon (website icon).status: The loading status of the tab, such as ""loading"", ""complete"", or ""unresponsive"".windowId: The unique identifier of the window that contains the tab.These are some of the commonly accessed properties for tab objects in browsers' extension APIs. The specific API documentation for the browser you are targeting will provide more detailed information about the available properties and their exact names.It's important to note that different browsers or API versions may have slight variations in the available tab properties or provide additional properties that offer more specialized functionality. Therefore, it's recommended to refer to the official documentation of the specific browser and version you are working with for precise information on tab properties."
"Is there any way to persist tab suspension across browser restarts? | 09, 17","Can I add custom properties to tab objects, such as an ID generated by my extension?
Will those persist?","No, you cannot directly add custom properties to the tab objects provided by the browser's extension APIs. The tab objects returned by the APIs are read-only, and any modifications you make to them will not persist or be saved by the browser.However, you can use other approaches to associate custom data or identifiers with tabs in your extension:Persistent Storage: You can use the chrome.storage API (Chrome) or the browser.storage API (Firefox) to store custom data related to tabs. This allows you to save and retrieve information associated with specific tab identifiers or other unique identifiers you generate within your extension. The stored data will persist even when the browser is restarted.External Data Structure: You can maintain an external data structure within your extension (e.g., an array or object) that maps custom identifiers to tab objects or other tab-related data. This allows you to associate custom properties or IDs with tabs and keep track of them within your extension. However, you would need to manage this data structure and ensure synchronization with the tab objects when relevant events occur (e.g., tab creation, removal, or updates).By using these techniques, you can effectively associate custom properties or IDs with tabs in your extension and persistently store the associated data even across browser restarts."
"2023-06-9 - Databases, data warehouses, and data lakes - Chewing the Fat 📈 | 00, 32","Data lake and data warehouse are bad names, they don’t explain what they are.","That's a fair point. The terms ""data lake"" and ""data warehouse"" are indeed industry jargon, and without context, they may not clearly communicate their purpose.A data warehouse is a large storage repository that stores data in a structured format. It's similar to a physical warehouse where goods are stored systematically for easy access, retrieval, and analysis. Hence, the term 'data warehouse'.On the other hand, a data lake is a storage repository that holds a vast amount of raw data in its native format until it is needed. The metaphor of a 'lake' is used to symbolize that it contains data in its raw, unprocessed state - much like a natural body of water might contain a wide variety of life in an unrefined state.I agree that these names may not be immediately self-explanatory, but they do carry some metaphorical weight that hints at their function. This kind of jargon is quite common in the tech industry."
"Improved UX and Security: Switching to Time-based One Time Passwords (TOTPs)! | 13, 12","Would that `@@unique` directive work if I used `upsert` when creating verification codes for which one of that type already exists?

Also, if I wanted to use a table for the `type` instead of a string, how would I do that?","@@unique in Prisma:The @@unique directive in Prisma does not directly interact with upsert. @@unique enforces that the combination of fields it's applied to must be unique in the database.When using upsert (update or insert), if a matching record already exists in the database (i.e., the same verificationTarget and type), Prisma will try to update that record. If no matching record exists, it will insert a new one.However, if a matching record exists but the update would violate the unique constraint (for example, if you're trying to change the verificationTarget or type to a combination that already exists for another record), you would get an error because the unique constraint is violated. So, in other words, upsert cannot be used to bypass the unique constraint.Using a separate table for type:You can certainly use a separate table for type if you'd like. This would allow you to add, remove, or modify verification types without needing to change your code. Here's an example of how you might structure this:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this setup, each Verification has a typeId which references an entry in the VerificationType table. The type field in VerificationType would hold the name of each verification type (like 'EMAIL', 'USER_ID').

Store the OTP and the generation time in the email_verification table.Send the OTP to the user's email as part of a magic link or a separate code.On User Verification: When the user clicks on the magic link or enters the OTP:Fetch the OTP and timestamp from the email_verification table for that user's email.If the timestamp is too old (say, more than 10 minutes), reject the verification.If the user clicked a magic link, compare the OTP in the magic link with the OTP from the database. If they match, the verification is successful.If the user entered a code manually, compare the entered OTP with the OTP from the database. If they match, the verification is successful.After successful verification, you should delete the OTP entry from the email_verification table to avoid reusing it.On User Requesting a New OTP: When the user asks for a new OTP/magic link:Generate a new OTP as in step 2.Replace the old OTP and timestamp in the email_verification table with the new OTP and current timestamp.This way, you're not storing the OTP in a cookie or a URL, you're keeping the database as the single source of truth, and you're maintaining a secure, user-friendly authentication workflow."
"Improved UX and Security: Switching to Time-based One Time Passwords (TOTPs)! | 14, 12",Nevermind. Let's leave the verification type as a string. I don't think it's enough of a benefit to have a separate model.,"That sounds reasonable. Using a string for the verification type keeps your schema simpler and will still meet your needs as long as you're careful to validate the values in your application code.Here is your final schema with the type field as a string:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Remember that you'll need to enforce in your application code that the type field can only take certain values (like 'EMAIL', 'USER_ID'), and handle cases where an attempt is made to insert a verification with a type or verificationTarget that already exists.This schema gives you flexibility to handle different types of verification, while keeping your data model straightforward and easy to understand. It strikes a good balance between complexity and flexibility."
"Improved UX and Security: Switching to Time-based One Time Passwords (TOTPs)! | 22, 12","Thinking about this more, I'm starting to think that this TOTP approach won't give me what I want. I was hoping to be able to let users verify their email address by typing a 5-6 digit number or clicking a link which includes that number in the query string. But it's possible (unlikely, but still possible) that two users could get the same number at the same time. I don't know how I'd prevent that or differentiate between those users.","Indeed, the issue you've brought up could potentially arise with the TOTP method, albeit it's extremely unlikely due to the nature of the algorithm used to generate the OTPs. That said, it's always good to consider all potential edge cases in security.As an alternative, you might consider a hybrid approach. For the link-based authentication, you could generate a unique, longer token that you include in the URL. This could be done using a cryptographic random function, ensuring that the chance of collision is essentially nil. This token could be used to look up the user and expiration time in your database (as with the TOTP method), but wouldn't be easily manually typed by the user due to its length.For the manual entry option, you could use the TOTP method to generate a shorter, more easily typed code. This code could be used in conjunction with the user's email (which you could ask the user to provide again when they type the code) to look up the user and expiration time in your database. This would mean that even if two users happened to have the same OTP (which is extremely unlikely), they would be differentiated by the associated email.Here's an example of how this could look:[CODE_BLOCK_0]Note: This solution requires updating the Verification model to include a linkToken field, and creating a unique constraint on linkToken. Also, you'll need to import crypto from Node.js core modules.This should give your users the convenience of either method of verification without the risk of OTP collision."
"Is there any way to persist tab suspension across browser restarts? | 01, 17",Does it get reset on browser restart?,"Yes, the tabId property is reset on browser restart. When you restart the browser, all tab IDs are regenerated, and previously assigned tabId values will no longer be valid or meaningful.Each time the browser starts, it treats tabs as new entities and assigns them new unique identifiers. This means that you cannot rely on tabId values persisting across browser restarts. If you need to store information or track tabs across browser sessions, you would need to use other means such as persistent storage (e.g., chrome.storage) or other identifiers like URLs or tab indices."
"Improved UX and Security: Switching to Time-based One Time Passwords (TOTPs)! | 28, 12","I just noticed the prisma model you generated has the otp as unique. I don't think this is necessarily correct. It is possible that multiple otp codes could be the same and that would not be a problem, right?","You're correct that it's technically possible for the OTPs to collide (i.e., two different keys generating the same OTP at the same time), but it's statistically very unlikely if the OTP is a sufficiently large random number (e.g., a 6-digit number has a million possible values).However, if you make the OTP a unique field in the database, then in the rare case that two OTPs do collide, you'll encounter a database error when you try to insert the second one. If you're generating a sufficiently large number of OTPs, this could become an issue.An alternative approach is to use a combination of the OTP and the verificationTarget (or the verificationTarget and type if type is not removed from the schema) as a unique constraint. This would allow the same OTP to be used for different targets, but not for the same target. This could be reasonable as it's unlikely that the same target will get the same OTP twice in a short period of time, but it would depend on the specifics of your application.In summary, you can remove the unique constraint on the OTP field if you're concerned about collisions, but consider whether you want to enforce uniqueness in some other way."

Here's an example of how you can retrieve the tabId of the current active tab:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this example, the chrome.tabs.query method is used to retrieve information about the currently active tab in the current window.

"Improved UX and Security: Switching to Time-based One Time Passwords (TOTPs)! | 03, 12",How hard would it be to implement TOPT without dependencies?,"Implementing TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) from scratch without using existing libraries is possible, but it's a non-trivial task. The TOTP algorithm is defined in RFC 6238, and involves a number of cryptographic operations, including HMAC-SHA1 hashing and Base32 encoding.Here's a rough outline of the steps you would need to follow:Generate a Secret Key: This will be a random binary string, typically 80 bits or longer. You could generate it using a cryptographically secure random number generator.Share the Secret Key: You need to securely share this secret key with the user. Often this is done by creating a QR code that the user can scan using an authenticator app.Generate the TOTP: This involves several steps:Calculate the number of time steps between an epoch (usually 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC) and the current time. The time step is typically 30 seconds.Convert this time step value to a byte array.Calculate the HMAC-SHA1 hash of this byte array, using the secret key.Perform some operations on this hash to convert it into a 6-digit number.Validate the TOTP: When the user provides a TOTP, you need to repeat the generation process and see if you get the same result.There are a number of complexities here, including handling time synchronization issues, ensuring all your cryptographic operations are secure, and dealing with different encodings and data types. Implementing these yourself can be error-prone and is generally not recommended unless you have a very good reason for doing so.If you're concerned about dependencies, one option could be to use a smaller, more focused library that only handles the HMAC-SHA1 and Base32 encoding parts, and implement the TOTP-specific parts yourself. But in general, using a well-maintained and widely-used library like speakeasy is going to be both safer and easier."
"Improved UX and Security: Switching to Time-based One Time Passwords (TOTPs)! | 27, 12","Sounds like proper key rotation would involve even more complexity than TOTP we've discussed because it will require a database table for the secret and a background job for rotating keys. Instead of dealing with all that, just having a database table to store the short lived unique keys for individual users seems much more simple and even more secure. So the only scenario where a shared encryption key makes sense in this situation is where you decide you don't have a fear of people taking the time and resources to guess your encryption secret key. I don't want to take that gamble for what I'm building, so I think it's best to make the Verification table as we discussed.

However, it looks like notp does not allow you to customize the algorithm used and it uses SHA1 which is no longer recommended due to security vulnerabilities. I'm considering just copy/paste/modifying that code into my codebase. Or is there another library I should use? I don't want to use `speakeasy` because it is quite old and has outstanding issues.","If you have security concerns with the libraries available and are comfortable with implementing the algorithm yourself, it's an option to do so. The algorithm used for TOTP is relatively straightforward and is well documented. The RFC 6238 document outlines how TOTP works and provides test values to verify your implementation.In terms of libraries, if notp and speakeasy are not to your liking, one option might be to use a more general purpose library that includes HMAC and SHA-256 or SHA-512, and implement the TOTP algorithm yourself.Node.js built-in crypto module provides HMAC and hash functions which can be used to implement TOTP:Use crypto.createHmac to create an HMAC object using SHA-256 or SHA-512 and your secret.Update the HMAC with the current time step (the difference between the current time and the Unix epoch, divided by the time step length).Use hmac.digest to generate the HMAC value.Select a 4-byte window from the HMAC value (the selection offset is the last nibble of the HMAC).Convert the 4-byte window to a number, and reduce it modulo 1,000,000 or 10^6 (for a 6-digit code).If you prefer to use a library for this, you might consider otplib. It's a more recently maintained library, which supports both HOTP and TOTP, and allows you to specify your own HMAC function, which means you can choose to use SHA-256 or SHA-512.However, if you choose to implement it yourself or use lower level libraries like crypto, do ensure to follow best practices for security, as improper implementation can lead to vulnerabilities.Please note, this information was current as of my training data up until September 2021. I recommend checking the latest state of these libraries or any newer alternatives before proceeding."

The Verification model has all the necessary fields: identifier for the value being verified, secretKey for the secret key used to generate the OTP, otp for the OTP itself, and expirationTime for when the OTP should expire.Keep in mind that the User model should be adjusted according to your needs.

"Is there any way to persist tab suspension across browser restarts? | 04, 17","So Chrome, Firefox or any browser would not save some unique tab ID?","No, browsers like Chrome, Firefox, or any other mainstream browser do not typically save or persist a unique tab ID that remains consistent across browser restarts. The concept of a unique tab identifier that persists across sessions is not a standard feature provided by browsers.When a browser is closed and reopened, the browser treats tabs as new entities and assigns them new identifiers. The previously assigned tab IDs are not retained or carried over to the next session.If you need to track tabs across browser restarts or persistently identify them, you would need to implement your own solution using techniques like persistent storage and generating unique identifiers for the tabs within your extension.

"Improved UX and Security: Switching to Time-based One Time Passwords (TOTPs)! | 19, 12","I'm thinking more about this. Going back to the original issue of hard coding the salt, can you describe what an adversary would have to do to exploit the vulnerability here? Perhaps I can do away with the salt entirely and simply encrypt it with a secret key. Also consider I could make it so the encrypted token is only valid for a short period. If I don't store the encrypted values in a database anywhere, how would my email verification method be practically susceptible to a rainbow table attack? Or would it be vulnerable to another kind of attack I'm not considering?

What steps would an attacker have to follow to crack my encryption even with a shared salt? If it's impractical, is there another method of encryption I could use that would still allow me to use a shared secret key and not bother with a salt since I won't need to store the values in a database anyway?","You're correct in assuming that an attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability of a hardcoded salt, but it's important to understand how and why this could happen.A salt is a random value that is generated for each instance of encryption, and it's usually concatenated with the password (or any other data you're encrypting) before the encryption process. This is particularly effective in preventing pre-computed dictionary attacks, commonly known as rainbow table attacks.A rainbow table attack works by pre-computing the hashes of all possible plaintexts and then storing them. An attacker can then simply look up the hash to get the plaintext. These are effective against systems where the same hash function is used across all records.Salting defends against this because it adds a unique value to each record, which means that pre-computed hashes are no longer effective. In this case, the attacker would need a unique rainbow table for each salt, which is computationally expensive and thus impractical.If you hardcode a salt, then you effectively have a system where the same salt is used across all records. This means an attacker only needs to compute a rainbow table once, which drastically reduces the complexity of an attack.Now, considering your case, where you're not storing the encrypted values anywhere, an attacker would have to intercept your encrypted tokens during transmission. This could happen through various methods, such as packet sniffing, man-in-the-middle attacks, or by gaining access to the email account where the tokens are sent.If the attacker has the encrypted token and the salt (which is hardcoded, and so could be found out by inspecting your system or through other means), then they could attempt a brute force attack to figure out the original payload, or use rainbow tables if the hashing function is known and the salt is the same across all tokens.The advantage of a time-limited token is that even if an attacker manages to intercept and decrypt a token, it will be useless after the expiration time, which adds an additional level of security. This reduces the time window in which an attacker can exploit a stolen token.As for an encryption method that uses a shared secret key and doesn't bother with a salt, you might want to look at symmetric encryption methods, such as AES. AES encryption is very strong and widely used. However, it still requires a key, which should be kept secure and definitely not hardcoded into your system.In summary, while it's true that your method is less susceptible to typical rainbow table attacks, it's still vulnerable to other forms of attacks, particularly if the attacker manages to gain access to your encryption key or your hardcoded salt. Adding unique, per-token salts and keeping your secret key secure will significantly improve the security of your system."
"Improved UX and Security: Switching to Time-based One Time Passwords (TOTPs)! | 00, 12","I'm building an authentication workflow that involves sending an email with a magic link to verify the user's email. I want to avoid doing anything in the database regarding the magic link. So I encrypt a payload (includes the email it's intended for and it doesn't include an expiration currently, but it certainly could) and include that encrypted token in the email as a query parameter on the magic link. However, I just realized that I was hard-coding the salt which reduces the level of security and opens me up to brute force attacks.

I'd still like to avoid touching the database for this, so I don't want to have to generate the salt and put it in the database. I considered putting the generated salt in the magic link query string as well. I realize this reduces the security a bit, but I'm wondering whether in a practical scenario if it's really that big of an issue and if I can address any holes that opens me up to.

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this. Feel free to make a completely different suggestion I may not have considered or tell me that I really should just write something to the database for this process.

I have also considered putting the salt in the user's session.

I'm also adding a feature that allows the user to enter 5 random numbers into the app instead of clicking a link. Those numbers will be encrypted using the same method and that encrypted value will be stored in a cookie.

Hopefully that's enough context for you to make a recommendation on what I should do about the salt.","Creating secure authentication workflows can be a tricky business, but it's great that you're giving this a lot of thought. Here are some options you might consider:Use a dynamic, non-secret value as a salt: Instead of hard-coding the salt or including it in the link, you could derive it from some other value that you're already sending. For example, you could use a hashed version of the user's email as the salt. This would provide unique salts for each user without you having to store them anywhere. However, since the email address itself isn't secret, this wouldn't necessarily add a lot of security - it would primarily serve to thwart precomputed dictionary attacks (""rainbow tables"").Include the salt in the link: While you're right that this reduces security somewhat, it might be a reasonable compromise given your requirements. A potential attacker would still need to break your encryption in order to use the link, and if your encryption is strong, this should be difficult. To make the links safer, consider using a secure random generator to produce the salt.Store the salt in a user session: This could work, but user sessions typically live on the server, so this would contradict your requirement of not touching the database (unless you're using a stateless JWT-style session, in which case you're back to sending the salt to the client).JWT tokens: You could use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to create the magic links. JWTs are a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. You can include the user's email and an expiration time in the token, then sign it using a secret key. When the user clicks the link, you validate the token and, if it's valid and not expired, the email is verified. You don't need to store anything in the database, and there's no need for a salt because you're not hashing anything. The downside is that if an attacker gets your secret key, they can create valid tokens.TOTP for random numbers: If you're asking users to enter random numbers, consider using Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) algorithm. It generates a one-time password based on the current time and a secret key. The server knows the secret key and can generate its own OTPs to compare with what the user entered. The nice thing about TOTP is that it automatically includes expiration (because the OTP changes over time), and if you only accept each OTP once, it can't be reused even if it's intercepted.In general, make sure to use secure, up-to-date cryptographic algorithms and libraries. Older algorithms and libraries may have known vulnerabilities that make your system easier to attack. Consider also rate limiting attempts to use the magic link to mitigate brute force attacks."
"Is there any way to persist tab suspension across browser restarts? | 05, 17","Ok, then a workaround would be to identify tabs by window, position and URL, whether it's pinned. In the case of a tab that changes URL on browser restart, previous URL would have to be looked at in its tab history, right?","Yes, identifying tabs based on window, position, URL, and pinned status can be a viable workaround when persistently tracking tabs across browser restarts. This combination of attributes can help differentiate tabs and provide a reasonable level of identification.If a tab changes its URL between browser restarts, and you want to access the previous URL, you can utilize the tab's history. The browser typically maintains a history of visited URLs for each tab, which includes the previous URLs visited within that tab's session.To access the tab's history and retrieve the previous URL, you can use the chrome.tabs.get method along with the tabId to get detailed information about the tab, including its history. Here's an example:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In the above code, tabId represents the unique identifier of the tab you want to retrieve information for. The chrome.tabs.get method retrieves the tab information, including the current URL (tab.url) and the tab's history (tab.history). You can access the previous URL from the tab.url property and explore the tab.history array to retrieve additional URLs from the tab's session history.By utilizing this approach, you can track tabs based on their window, position, URL, and pinned status, and retrieve the previous URL if a tab's URL has changed between browser restarts."

This means that when the browser is reopened, you can navigate back and forward through the pages you visited in the previous session.Pinned Tabs: If any tabs were pinned before closing the browser, they are usually restored as pinned tabs in the next session.Tab Order: The order of the tabs is generally preserved. If you had multiple tabs open in a specific order before closing the browser, they will usually be restored in the same order when the browser is reopened.Unsaved Form Data: In some cases, if you had entered data into form fields on a webpage but had not submitted the form before closing the browser, the unsaved form data may be restored when the browser is reopened.It's important to note that the specific behavior may vary depending on the browser and its settings.

From what I can tell, the shared secret is the `secretKey` which is stored in the database. I don't believe that is shared with the client which is why I'm confused by the ""shared"" adjective here.

And the ""server"" and ""client"" in my instance is just the node.js server. I don't think we want to send anything other than the `otp` in the email.","I apologize for the confusion. You're correct. In the context of your application, the terms ""shared secret"", ""client"", and ""server"" may not be applicable in the traditional sense.Here's a clarification:The ""shared secret"" is indeed the secretKey in the context of your application, which is stored in the database. The term ""shared"" generally refers to the fact that it is known by both the server and the client in a typical TOTP setup. However, in your specific case, the secretKey isn't really ""shared"" in the traditional sense, as it's not communicated to the end-user or their device. It remains securely on the server side.The ""server"" is your Node.js server. It generates the OTP and verifies it when the user submits it for validation.The ""client"" in a typical TOTP setup usually refers to an application or device that is able to generate an OTP based on the shared secret and the current time. However, in your case, the ""client"" is the user who receives the OTP via email and then submits it for validation.Your system is essentially a server-side version of TOTP, where the OTP generation and verification both happen on the server, and the OTP itself is communicated to the client via email, rather than being generated by a client-side application or device. This is a sensible adaptation of the TOTP scheme to your particular requirements, and retains the core security property of TOTP, which is that the passwords are one-time and time-limited."

What issues do you foresee with me making this database table more generic? So instead of ""email"" we'd use more generic terms?","Making your database table more generic shouldn't be an issue and could allow for more flexibility in handling different kinds of verification scenarios.

"Improved UX and Security: Switching to Time-based One Time Passwords (TOTPs)! | 20, 12","If the attacker gains access to my encryption key then they would be able to generate their own tokens and login as anyone. It's pretty well accepted that's bad news.

From what I can tell, following the TOTP approach we've arrived at above would be the safest approach because even if the verifications table was breached, the attackers would have limited use for that as they would only be able to impersonate users whose verification had not yet expired (and with reasonably short expirations that would limit the number of vulnerable users drastically). Additionally, there's no secret key that could be lost, so they also wouldn't be able to generate their own valid tokens. An attacker would need to get write access to the database in which case we'd probably have even bigger problems anyway (so we'll apply good security practices around database access already). Am I missing something about the vulnerabilities around the TOTP? Is it a correct characterization to say that TOTP is similar in spirit to what I'm doing already except there's no salt and instead the encryption secret is randomly generated for every instance of verification and saved to the database and only valid before the expiration time?","Yes, your characterization is largely correct. A Time-Based One-Time Password (TOTP) system, like the one we've discussed, indeed adds a significant layer of security.To clarify, in a TOTP system, the one-time password is generated from a shared secret and the current timestamp. The server and the client both generate the TOTP independently and then the client sends its version to the server for verification. If the server's generated TOTP matches the client's TOTP, then the client is authenticated.A key aspect of this is that the shared secret must be securely stored and protected against unauthorized access. In our case, the shared secret is stored in the database and associated with a particular verification event. If an attacker were to gain access to the database and the shared secret, they could theoretically generate the TOTP if the TOTP hasn't expired yet. However, once the TOTP expires, it's of no use to an attacker.So, the primary vulnerability of the TOTP system is the secure storage of the shared secret and the secure communication of the TOTP to the client (e.g., via email or some other means). If the database were to be compromised and the shared secret was stolen, an attacker could potentially generate the TOTP, but again, this is only useful if they are able to do this before the TOTP expires.Overall, implementing a TOTP system, as we've discussed, will provide a robust level of security for your application, particularly if you ensure secure storage of shared secrets and implement a short expiration time for the TOTP. The lack of a salt in the TOTP system is not a significant issue, as each TOTP is unique to a particular timestamp and shared secret, essentially performing a similar function as a salt in password hashing."
"Improved UX and Security: Switching to Time-based One Time Passwords (TOTPs)! | 16, 12","Ok, sounds good. I'm satisfied with the model and the architecture we've discussed. I'm considering whether I should include this model in my application database or if I should create a separate database for this. I'm using SQLite for all my databases and I already have a separate one for caching, so adding another one for verification doesn't feel like a big issue, particularly since the model is so simple so I wouldn't actually need prisma to manage it. Please argue both sides of this decision and make a recommendation.","Adding the verification model to your existing application database versus creating a new, separate database for it presents a trade-off between simplicity and isolation. Both approaches have their benefits and drawbacks.Including in the existing application database:Benefits:Simplicity: Having your verification model in the same database as the rest of your application data can simplify your architecture. You won't need to maintain a separate connection to a different database for the sole purpose of managing verification records.Consistency: By keeping all data in one place, you can take advantage of database transactions to ensure data consistency. For example, if you need to create a user and a verification record at the same time, you can do it in a single transaction.Drawbacks:Coupling: Changes in your main database schema or settings could potentially impact your verification data. This is especially true if the database becomes large and complex, making schema changes more risky.Potential performance issues: If your main application database handles a high volume of transactions, the added load of managing verification records could contribute to performance issues.Creating a separate database for verification:Benefits:Isolation: By keeping verification data in a separate database, you can ensure that changes to your main application database don't affect your verification process. This can make it easier to manage and scale each part of your system independently.Performance: If your verification process generates a high volume of read and write operations, moving it to its own database could alleviate potential performance issues in your main database.Drawbacks:Complexity: Maintaining multiple databases increases the complexity of your architecture. You'll need to manage multiple connections, handle cross-database transactions if necessary, and ensure that each database is properly backed up and maintained.Cost: Depending on your hosting provider, maintaining an additional database may add to your costs.Recommendation:Given your use case and the simplicity of the verification model, I would lean towards including it in your main application database. This would keep your architecture simpler and still allow you to handle verifications effectively.However, if you find that verification operations are adding a significant load to your main database, or if you want to maintain a strict separation of concerns, then it would make sense to move verifications to a separate database. Ultimately, the best choice depends on the specific needs and constraints of your application."

"Improved UX and Security: Switching to Time-based One Time Passwords (TOTPs)! | 18, 12","Great. Thanks. A few bits of feedback:

1. Please rewrite that to native ESM and TypeScript.
2. The prisma client comes from `import { prisma } from '~/utils/db.server.ts'`
3. Let's make function arguments objects that are destructured in the argument list position.
4. Let's make the expiration time an argument
5. Could you fill in the `generateSecretKey` function with an implementation?

Thanks!","Sure, here is a revised version that meets your requirements:[CODE_BLOCK_0]This module is written in TypeScript and uses native ECMAScript modules (ESM). The createTOTP and verifyTOTP functions take options objects as arguments, which are destructured within the argument list.The generateSecretKey function generates a secret key by creating a buffer with crypto.randomBytes(32), which generates 32 random bytes of data, and then converts that to a hexadecimal string with .toString('hex').The expirationTime is now a parameter to the createTOTP function.Let me know if you have any other questions or need further adjustments."
"Improved UX and Security: Switching to Time-based One Time Passwords (TOTPs)! | 05, 12",Could you write me a module that would be responsible for generating and verifying a TOTP that can be emailed to users for email verification? I want to use the notp module from npm. Please call out whether anything needs to be saved in a database and any environment variables.,"Sure, I can help you with that. We're going to use the notp package for the TOTP generation and verification and crypto for creating a secret key.Here's a simple module that handles these tasks:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In this simple setup, nothing needs to be stored in a database. When you generate an OTP, you would email it to the user, and then when the user provides an OTP for verification, you would call verifyOTP(). If it returns a truthy value, the OTP is valid; otherwise, it's not.However, note that for this to be secure in a real system, each user should have a unique secret key, and you should securely store these keys. Here, we're using the same key for all users, which is not secure.As for environment variables, this setup doesn't require any. However, if you were storing the secret key(s) in an environment variable or a database, you would need to handle that.Please keep in mind that security is a complex field and there may be other considerations and potential vulnerabilities depending on the specifics of your system and use case. Always consider consulting with a security expert when designing or modifying an authentication system."

"Improved UX and Security: Switching to Time-based One Time Passwords (TOTPs)! | 12, 12","I'm using SQLite which doesn't support enum. Could you update the VerificationType to address this. Also, I don't think we need to include the User model anymore.

Also, is the term ""identifier"" the best option for what that really represents?","SQLite indeed does not natively support ENUM type, but you can emulate it using CHECK constraints. However, to keep things simple and portable between databases, you could just use a string field for type and enforce the allowed values in your application code.Regarding the term ""identifier"", it's quite generic and may not immediately convey its purpose. Since it could represent either an email or a user ID depending on the context, you might consider using a term like ""verificationValue"" or ""verificationTarget"" to be a bit more descriptive.Here's an updated schema:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In your application code, you can then enforce that the type field must be one of a specific set of allowed values (e.g., 'EMAIL', 'USER_ID').Keep in mind that you should still ensure the verificationTarget and type combination is unique. This could be done in your application logic, or you can enforce it at the database level by adding a unique constraint on both fields:[CODE_BLOCK_1]This ensures that for each verification type, a particular target can only have one active verification at a time."
"Improved UX and Security: Switching to Time-based One Time Passwords (TOTPs)! | 26, 12","One way I could side-step the Brute-Force Attack Vulnerability would be to rotate encryption keys on a regular basis, right? If so, what's a reasonable frequency for that? I'm thinking that I could have a short grace period for old secrets as well to avoid issues with tokens generated moments before the switch. Would this resolve the brute-force attack vulnerability?

If so, are there any other vulnerabilities I'm not considering?","Key rotation is indeed a common practice in cryptography to mitigate the risk of key exposure. However, the effectiveness of key rotation in preventing brute-force attacks depends on a few factors:Rotation Frequency: The rotation frequency should be set according to the perceived risk and capability of the attacker. In theory, a higher rotation frequency can make brute-force attacks harder by reducing the time window an attacker has to crack the key. However, too frequent rotation may cause operational issues, and tokens generated with old keys will become invalid unless you maintain a grace period system.Grace Period: As you mentioned, maintaining a grace period during which tokens encrypted with old keys are still accepted can help with operational smoothness during key transitions. However, this also means that the effectiveness of key rotation in preventing brute-force attacks is somewhat reduced, as the time window for cracking the old key is extended.Key Strength: Key rotation can be less effective if the encryption keys are not strong enough to begin with. If your encryption key is weak or guessable, an attacker might be able to crack it before the next rotation.Rotating keys regularly can certainly increase the security of your system, but it's not a silver bullet. You still need to consider other potential vulnerabilities and security measures. For instance, key management and secure storage of keys become more critical in a system with frequent key rotation. If an attacker can access your new keys (e.g., by compromising the system where keys are generated or stored), key rotation won't help much.Another potential vulnerability could be if an attacker is able to intercept the communication between the server and the client (e.g., man-in-the-middle attack). This could reveal not just the encrypted tokens, but also other sensitive information. Therefore, it's important to secure the communication channels as well, e.g., using HTTPS for web traffic.Additionally, secure handling of email communication is critical since the OTP is sent via email. If an attacker can intercept or access the user's email, they can get the OTP. Therefore, secure email practices, such as using secure email servers and encouraging users to use strong email passwords and two-factor authentication, can also be helpful.Lastly, remember that no system is perfectly secure. The goal is to make attacking the system more costly (in terms of time, effort, and resources) than the potential gain from the attack. A layered approach to security, which combines several security measures, can help achieve this goal."
"Is there any way to persist tab suspension across browser restarts? | 06, 17","Yeah, which events do I need to track in order to observe any tab change?","To observe tab changes in a Chrome extension, you can use the following events:chrome.tabs.onCreated: This event is triggered when a new tab is created. You can listen to this event to track the creation of new tabs.chrome.tabs.onUpdated: This event is fired when a tab is updated, such as when the URL or title of the tab changes, or when the tab's loading state changes. By listening to this event, you can track changes in tab properties.chrome.tabs.onRemoved: This event is triggered when a tab is closed or removed. You can use this event to keep track of tab removals.By registering event listeners for these events, you can track various tab-related changes within your Chrome extension. Here's an example of how you can register listeners for these events:[CODE_BLOCK_0]In the above code, each event listener function receives relevant information about the tab, such as the tab object, tabId, changeInfo, or removeInfo, which you can use to track and process the tab changes as needed.By combining these event listeners, you can effectively observe tab creations, updates, and removals within your Chrome extension."
